The picture is taken by a photographer that goes by the online username of “kruwt”. It’s funny cause I stumbled upon this on Instagram or Twitter randomly, but I loved it so much at first sight that I had to do some research about it. The painting starts from a rejected project that Lemoyne finished for Versailles, but while he was doing something so big he was also suffering a lot. While I was making the tracks you hear now in the EP, I wasn’t into a pretty good mental state and music was the only escape for me. At some point, the fact that I happened to produce something I was happy with made me feel like I’ve overcome a lot of all those demons, so to me the ‘Apotheosis’ subject meant something too. \"","title":"Apotheosis"},"title":"safe","trackNumber":3,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0xb2dc9de25af5729e326b0c3c6093dcfb1a872d1a6a19bc325b69080a8e5264ae4e05120855b345dee7d6b63b84fd3db428d5a3d49c8ec60a91981b29e38e466d1b","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"},"name":"safe","description":"\" [Safe] seems to symbolize our arrival in the dungeons of the camoufly project, the place where his incessant experimentation takes place and where his fabulous ideas take shape. \" - Alessio Anesi, FUXWITHIT\r\n\r\n\"Safe\" is the second single from my debut EP \"Apotheosis\".\r\nA song that embraces vulnerabilty with mellow but definite melodies, like a shelter from the storm.\r\nA song that features instruments from multiple cultures, all together in harmony.\r\nThis is \"Safe\"."},"address":"0xabefbc9fd2f806065b4f3c237d4b59d9a97bcac7","tokenId":"2595"},"manifestations":[{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://neume.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeiaplywzwanr4h6opyjokltjeic63pbykzsf422qqbdfoogoqr6sve"},{"version":"0.1.0"}]}

Rather than purely creating pastiches of classical shakuhachi music, our goal was an AI model that adds novel features and idiosyncrasies in a systemic way, making worthwhile contributions to the contemporary shakuhachi repertoire. \n\nThe three pieces were all composed by the same generative AI model, despite their great variances in length and material, suggesting the model has successfully learned many of the deeper underlying features of the classical solo shakuhachi repertoire, allowing it to create original and wide-ranging works with clear referral to the Honkyoku aesthetic.","title":"GANkyoku"},"title":"GANkyoku III","trackNumber":3,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0x5f424f529d94727c82d0ffa04e4d370b786c2dec23f4d031a1c190e35e27a11e49e6a10c871ec282b36f10316c1e2dee9f5ef1a8dfb1d3247ef0e10b30c724201b","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"},"name":"GANkyoku III","description":"GANkyoku III - 1 shaku 8 sun length \n\nShakuhachi: Shawn 'Renzoh' Head\n\nProduction: Omar Peracha\n\nArtwork: Omar Peracha"},"address":"0xabefbc9fd2f806065b4f3c237d4b59d9a97bcac7","tokenId":"3398"},"manifestations":[{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://neume.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeictcvq3yvdzpmyfxii7b3p4cuij2pa3jnt3wrttrvltiqch6xbruy"},{"version":"0.1.0"}]}

I’d add to that humility and grace, infused with the power that comes from offering with an open hand from a place of love.\n\nAll bidders on this NFT will be entered into a raffle to win the exclusive number 3 (of 4) vinyl pressing of the Motherland Suite hand-pressed on translucent vinyl.

Really, everyone says that I'm some genre-bending virtuoso or what have you, and this was my way of trying to live up to that a bit, while putting my signature twist on things. Everything about this album, each song, each name title, the order of the songs, how many songs there are, even in a sense, the duration of the songs and the whole album, were intentionally decided upon and modified to convey my own personal message: to you as well as myself. Interpret it as you will, look up the meanings of the name titles, stare at and bask in the grandiosity that is the album cover, but most importantly, listen intently. As loud as you can.

After independently releasing over 10 albums over the past couple of years, San Diego's very own AbJo has created Soulection's third installment. AbJo has been on our radar for quite sometime and it was only necessary that we created a project that represents both of our visions.\n\nSankofa resembles a soundscape that ranges from Future-Soul, Jazz, Eclectic-Fusion, Hip-Hop, & Deep-Thought sounds that trigger your mind into the thought of what The Sound of Tomorrow should sound like. AbJo designs a sound visual that incorporates heavy snares, hi-hats, future-drums, vintage-pianos, timeless-samples, & crisp synths that bring out your roots.\n\n\"I've been making beats for the better part of 4 years, but I've been musically involved since I was 9, so about 13 years now....There are a lot of influences in my life, but the biggest ones were my father's music collection, my classical music background, The Roots (my favorite hip hop band, period), Dilla and Madlib, and jazz music in general. These days, though, cats like Dibia$e, Freddie Joachim and FlyLo are my biggest inspirations...Sankofa means \"to return from whence you came\", but to me it also means to re-complete the cycle, the same cycle you've been completing since your soul has inhabited this existance; to basically go back to your roots again, renewed and evolved from the last time you progressed, to reflect and be one with yourself again, as you always have been...\"\n-AbJo","title":"Sankofa"},"title":"Kalimba Song","trackNumber":1,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0x7eb2013b2f7bbcd38d196262a1bdad3f17f2c8c06fa8f39505d95993982e175912171cb7b9950483973bcd96511d4485d49a4fa7921e19e5b88869e403b4e1141b","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"},"name":"Kalimba Song","description":"The single off my debut release on Soulection, \"Sankofa\", proto-future beats vibes.

The album began while Josh was living in Mexico City. For weeks Josh was living in a small apartment and would walk through the city. One of the streets he walked on was Manzanillo St. and the characters and environment would inspire many of the songs and artwork for the album. Borrowing time from a friend’s small studio and recording in the living room of his apartment, the basics for the album took shape. For most of the year Lippi was touring the world working for other artists and would continue to write in the backstages of clubs, vans, tour busses and planes. On a break between tours Josh pulled a four day stand at the legendary Different Fur studios in San Francisco, CA, literally sleeping on the couch in the control room and put all the pieces together to complete the record. Taking on most of the instruments himself and releasing the record on his own Truth Music Label, Josh Lippi & The Overtimers emote the energy and spirit of DIY music, putting in the overtime work to get things done independently.","title":"Manzanillo St."},"title":"For Nana","trackNumber":6,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0xc85dc4a00f3ced5bf3607ee1a4558265486fafe4f576b0cdaa1a57f4ec652c34161a4bfa5b1632c9118392c381401b218b68dde3e42e8f855a4dc0cc5b2db2ed1b","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"},"name":"For Nana","description":"Wrote this for my Grandma Rosemary. \n\nJosh Lippi - guitar, upright bass, mandolin, synth\nDerek Taylor - drums\n\nWritten and Produced by Josh Lippi \n\nRecorded at Pedro Y El Lobo studios Mexico City, The Torta Oven San Francisco, CA, and Different Fur Studios San Francisco, CA.\nRecorded & mixed by Seal Paulson and Josh Lippi.\nMastered by Brian Lucey"},"address":"0xabefbc9fd2f806065b4f3c237d4b59d9a97bcac7","tokenId":"4371"},"manifestations":[{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://neume.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeifm5eozdm7bteonprwferatuayau44siv4gl5uluqar63lfqa67py"},{"version":"0.1.0"}]}

Push is a confident step forward from Maral’s club & mixtape work into a powerful collection of original songs. Push’s palette includes a collage of Iranian Classical & Folk samples, and explores genres of experimental electronic production touching upon noise, punk/post-punk, and dub. Maral writes, “I think it represents me wanting the music to Push people towards thinking about sound/music in a different way and me pushing myself to create something new - different than my last record. As well as this feeling towards society - of wanting them to Push to be better and more forward-thinking in how we can make the world a better place.”\n\n“I try to incorporate the philosophy behind Iranian classical music, the importance of improvisation, by letting my samples play around with each other until they become friends. And if they click, that makes a good song,” says Maral. Push bursts with urgent psychedelic energy, but its songs also grapple with a somber undercurrent. “The history of Iranian music has a lot of melancholy in it. So much of Iranian history is sad. Since ancient times, Iranians were always fighting off invasions.” Push heavily features the Setar, an Iranian lute instrument that Maral has played for years and the instrument of choice for Sufi mystics who use it to transcend beyond the notes. Maral adds, “The quiet nature of the Setar allowed it to flourish during times of invasion when Persian culture and music was banned and needed to be played/passed down in secret.”\n\nThe songs on Push feel vividly personal yet constantly besieged by harsh walls of distortion and abrupt shifts. Maral describes it as the sound of fleeting music, where “imaginary band members are being pulled back and forth by a supernatural vortex - suddenly they disappear and reappear as something new. I wanted this record to sound like I was in a band with the samples - where the samples are each a band member. I kind of see myself as the drummer in the band but also I have the lead vocal duties on ‘Sweet Thing,’ ‘No Type,’ and ‘Let The Distortion Sing.’” Releasing tracks with her vocals is a new step for Maral, who reworked the tracks “Sweet Thing” and “No Type” from experiments spanning 4 years with producer So Drove at the Red Bull Music Academy Studios in Los Angeles. They are both love songs, “Sweet Thing” a reassurance to a partner that being together will be “the sweetest thing,” and “No Type” a reinterpretation of the Rae Sremmurd song to say that the partner is “just my type, only thing that I like.” Maral describes Push’s sweeping, transient nature as “this feeling of driving in a car with the windows down and you have your own music playing but also can hear what’s going on outside, and the way those sounds can meld together to create a beautiful song for just a couple of seconds and disappear.”\n\nPush’s marked punk and dub influences are reinforced by intriguing guest features from dub legend Lee “Scratch” Perry and Penny Rimbaud, co-founder of Anarcho-Punk band Crass. “The Penny Rimbaud song came about from me contacting him to show him Mahur Club and to tell him how much Crass has had an influence on me, sonically and philosophically,” Maral writes. “He suggested we collaborate and sent me a poem that I created the song around. The poem is about the events in Iraq and Gaza but can apply to much of the Middle East and the role of western imperialism in that region.”\n\nMaral writes, “At the time that I was making the record, it was when U.S.-Iran relations were really bad. The songs with the Iranian samples have this feeling of spiritual melancholy that is an ingrained part of being Iranian, and I made them thinking about the horrible impacts the sanctions and in general USA’s actions have had on the country and how it just never lets up - the western imperialism that is hell bent on destroying the people in the guise of ‘saving them.’ The songs are kind of my battle of not letting the negative thoughts overcome me and wanting to pass down the beauty and feeling of perseverance that is a part of Iranian culture and music.”","title":"Push"},"title":"Dashti","trackNumber":4,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0x722ed4e7dad7b2af994c6bc296282bbba7e0464bd77d6cc4e4f7e999894b02807f580c30b9896ab0c34f6efaa4505bb3c4931bdd8bdd8db253d97a77e8080b6a1c","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"},"name":"Dashti","description":"Los Angeles-based Iranian-American producer and DJ Maral presents her genesis NFT “Dashti” from her debut album Push (Leaving Records 2020).

It started as a techno track, with the main synth line and a kick drum, but I wasn't satisfied so I kept working on it year after year, reopening the project and adding one new element at a time.

The record releases September 25th on Cable's imprint Dome of Doom and is the 8th full-length in his catalog. The compositional formats across the 40 minute album are dense and dynamic, bursting with heavy rhythms, crystalized harmonies, soothing breakdowns, and technical finesse. IDM, downtempo, lofi house, 808 filled trap, LA-centric beats, musique concrète, drum ‘n bass, jungle, modern classical; it’s an encyclopedia of 21st century sound that interlaces Cable’s musical voice with distinction and purpose. In this context, the album acts as one of the artists’ most realized works in musical range. Features across Shimmer, Then Disappear include a number of artists connected to the Dome of Doom family: God Damn Chan, Holly, Call Me and Goodnight Cody. Cable mixed the entire LP, with mastering from Daddy Kev at Cosmic Zoo Studios. Album artwork was completed by Dewey Saunders, an artist internationally known for album cover work with Anderson Paak, Future, Nxworries, Felly, Griz, and more.\n\nThe collaborative recording process and abundance of gear on Shimmer, Then Disappear makes this an album of constant surprises and new revelations on repeated listens. Most sessions were completed at Cable’s home studio in the hills of LA and the gear set-up included a laptop, Ableton, Kitten Octave, Oberheim/Viscount OB-3 Squared, Roland TR-8, Roland JP-08, Critter & Guitari Pocket Piano GR, Arturia Keystep, Moog Sirin, AKG C214, and the AKG C 414 B-ULS. The Roland TR-8 and the Roland JP-08 were both given to Cable on loan by Daedelus right before he set off to Boston for his new position at Berklee on the EDI faculty. Daedelus' only request was that Cable keep making music. Argentina’s Dabow and Portugal’s Holly were both in Los Angeles during the same week last year, creating at Cable’s studio for a day straight and coming up with one of the record’s hardest hitting tracks. Maine’s God Damn Chan also created his two features at Cable’s studio during a trip to the west coast last year, knocking out their collaborations with speed and ferocity. They dive in and out of musical ideas first poured from pioneering and next generation artists across Warp and Ninja Tune. Los Angeles multi-instrumentalist Goodnight Cody was the only musician to record his part outside of Cable’s studio, submitting a solo recording of slide guitar for future processing and reconfiguring. Like many of his records over the years, Cable also adds vox, supplanting lyrics of self-examination and personal perseverance that are some of his most direct and intentional lyrics ever. All collaborations occurred before the COVID-19 pandemic, cementing the structure of the LP well before its eventual release in 2020.\n\nAfter the mental fog created from the world's collective state of social unrest started to slowly subside and the changing landscape within the touring/music industry was adapted to, Cable was able to initiate the second process of the album and flesh out the rest of the music. In March, during the initial shutdowns in Los Angeles, Cable locked himself in his home studio for a period of weeks and began making a new song every day. This would initiate first thing in the morning when he woke up. It happened slowly but it became an important process in finishing the record and creating most of the new solo material. In this process chain of the recording sessions and what was absorbed during those times, the album is a bridge from the world we knew into the world we all live in now. A perfect reflection of the transitional energy that was brought onto the world collectively over the last nine months. Closing the album in a similar fashion to past records with a beatless and sobering piece, the Mac Miller tribute “Mac Flip” was sourced from a sample Cable found online from a Canadian producer by the name Two Swings. It ties in the final scope of the record with a reflection on artistic influence and the value we hold on those who are still here and those who leave us. Labelmate thook, who released his Noise LP on DoD last year, was the one who first showed Cable the track. “I discovered this artist Two Swings from Canada through thook, who released his Noise LP on the label last year. Two Swings had made a song called \"Tribute to Malcolm\" that was released on SoundCloud, and I found it through a repost on thook's account. It's a really beautiful piece and starts with this piano and string section that I used to create my flip of the song. The original version from Two Swings then goes on to drop into a remix with some of Malcolm's vocals, etc. I just clipped the initial few second loop and used it as material to compose new melodies with. I also reached out to Two Swings to get their blessings to use the sample, since it sounded to me like the intro was an original recording. They were down so it ended up on the record.”\n\nConceptually, Shimmer, Then Disappear is presented with an overall flow that connects all titles and thematic song styles as one dynamic story. The creator of this work takes up the lead character role, soul searching as realities start to cave in and exit ramps ensue. Cable elaborates further on the conceptual theme of the album, “The first song is called \"How to Disappear\", the second song is called \"Travel Light'', then the next \"End All Contracts.'' To me, the tracklist reads like a deranged to-do list of this character that is attempting to erase themselves and start a new life. Read chronologically, the track list tells the story of someone attempting to disappear, but coming up against all the pitfalls that, as humans, we all have. \"Contacting People from your Past\", \"The Lure of Personal Success\" and \"Short Game vs Long Game\" all speak to our desires to be connected to others. It is no way natural for us as a species to be isolated or cut off from our family groups, but in our modern world this has increasingly become the case whether we like it or not. I feel like I tell that story most directly on \"Change Your Name\" with the lyrics \"What you see, is what you get, and what if you could change your name? Would you run from your regrets, or would you keep it all the same?\" I guess for me music is always just a time capsule of my life at the time I was making it.” Pacing, peaks, valleys, bursts, the calm; every track follows from one another energetically and offers a personal unpacking of one’s soul. A vulnerability in transmitted reflections that pushes postering and ego to the side.\n\nThe album title for Shimmer, Then Disappear has roots dug into Wylie Cable’s CalArts days in the early 2000s and his initial discovery of the works of Muslimgauze during this time. Wylie pulled the LP's title from a Muslimgauze song of the same name that appears on the 1997 LP Jaal Ab Dullah (Soleilmoon Recordings). “I'm sure the reference will be lost on 99% of people though as Muslimgauze has become a more obscure name in the electronic music collectors world. I personally have been obsessed with his music since college though. My old friend David Cohen introduced me to Muzlimgauze's music in his CalArts sublevel studio in the film department. We used to hang out endlessly and listen to the dudes music trying to figure out how he made all this shit with dub tape loops in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s. I really think you hear a lot of Muslimgauze influence in all of underground bass music, even if it's not a commonly regarded opinion. The guy was making insane distorted 808 breakbeat loops, recording all his own percussion and samples and doing the takes live on a board playing it like an instrument, ala King Tubby and other dub pioneers that advanced music by approaching studio equipment with new ideas that became commonplace later. As far as what the title means to me personally, I feel it's yet another way to look at impermanence, here today, gone tomorrow sort of a thing. My hope is that with my time on the planet I can create some things that are beautiful that remind others that there is wonder and grace and love in human nature... then disappear.”\n\nWhile running Dome of Doom over the last nine years, unfiltered culture has been injected into the underground music community with every release, flipping a staggering 18,000+ cassette tapes since the label's inception. Releasing music on his own label has afforded Cable the creative flexibility to mold his releases in an uncompromised vision and to connect dots that are personalized and true to his goals as a creative artist looking to bring worthwhile change to this world. Shimmer, The Disappear is the ethos of this mission at its core, presenting one-of-a-kind fusions that find their origins as a synthesis of Cable’s time as a classically trained upright bassist and his lifelong experiences within the hip-hop, punk, hardcore, and electronic music communities.","title":"Shimmer, Then Disappear"},"title":"Carry Cash","trackNumber":11,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0x2be4e5c24e9ab408fd4668075c05a00d42c11735f7544bd5e97c78cb8589c9cd10f47b8eb6356f946f617c02b73ec3d5b7fd347577a5ce1c9bf09c11c5ccc4eb1b","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"},"name":"Carry Cash","description":"Hope you got some extra cash to catch the bus"},"address":"0xabefbc9fd2f806065b4f3c237d4b59d9a97bcac7","tokenId":"5498"},"manifestations":[{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://neume.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeihqfavfyqoo22rdlai736mldbucys7nsu2oq2vyajcszodb6cwowq"},{"version":"0.1.0"}]}

Penumbra is an introspective work that centers around the emotional vortex of a past relationship with each track serving as a chronological representation of each phase. “To be more on the nose, in order, \"Lilac\" represents the sort of initial honeymoon phase,” Saka adds. “\"Prescient\" represents starting to realize that things might not be so perfect after all. \"Penumbra\" exemplifies right before the breakup, and \"Let me Live\" being right after.” Saka's new EP differs in sound design and structural approach to past works, rooted in the language of songwriter-driven electronic music and accentuated with a sense of unbridled experimentation.\n\n\nOn Penumbra, Saka presents his vocals on record for the first time with “Prescient,” also introducing a new collaborator to his catalog with the last track, “Let Me Live (feat. Amethyst).\" Both pieces are soaked in a wave of deep emotional resonance, supplanted with harmonious lines, amorphous overtones, and complex patterns. Panoramic and tranquil, it sets a unique sense of balance to their counterpart bookends: the dance-floor euphoria of the EPs introductory piece “Lilac,” and the refractacted neck-snapping wild sonics of the title-track. All sides serving as important energetic windows into the type of emotional roller coaster Saka was on during his past relationship. The Penumbra recording sessions began in May of 2020 and the mixing/mastering process was finalized this year by Saka. \n\n\nA lot of the sound design for Penumbra was created on Ableton, mostly centered around the use of the Novation Peak, a synth Saka purchased at the beginning of 2020. Operator, Ableton's native FM synth, was also heavily used in the recording process. Saka adds further insight into the writing and recording behind Penumbra: “I began writing around the concept of Penumbra at the end of May last year. It's actually mostly about an ex, and the feelings I experienced throughout our relationship. Each track sort of represents a different time period of the relationship, in chronological order. I didn't really try to make any of these musical ideas fit into any specific sort of overarching genre, sort of just wrote from the heart in the sonic lexicon that I have. I wrote largely without intention, wanted to get my feelings out in musical format, so the tunes range from beats to DnB to garage. I was pretty patient with myself, I didn't really write this EP with any sort of deadline for myself. In fact, I spent time throughout 2020 largely creatively wandering, trying to figure out where I belonged in this electronic music space I'm in, all the while writing ideas for this throughout the year. I think Penumbra is sort of the culmination of me not really giving that attention anymore.

If the connection and meaning in creativity becomes devoid, there's a transformation process that either channels an ascension or departure. An internal and external battle that can chase and haunt individuals in every part of their life if one falls into the latter position.\n\n\nIn the case of Los Angeles based electronic producer Huxley Anne, ascension was achieved during one of these tests of creative endurance and preservation, entering a phase of her life where the process of feeling art on meaningful levels had subsided for a lengthy period and the eventual reprisal of these natural gifts returned. This led to the creation of her debut album and an expansion in creativity that marks an important beginning for her path as an artist. This work is known as Ilium, representing a moment in Huxley Anne's life that's been one of her most testing yet rewarding mountains to climb. Ilium is Huxley Anne's debut album with Los Angeles indie imprint and Alpha Pup Records affiliate, Dome of Doom. The album will release on limited edition cassette and digital platforms April 14, 2017.\n\n\nTo understand the road to Ilium, there is a specific time and place that initiated its origins. Upon arriving back to the States in February of 2012 after living in France, Huxley Anne found herself unable to feel emotion in the act of observing, interacting and creating art. This remained true for several years while she worked as a tech for one of the world's largest live sound companies. During a visit to the Broad Museum, Huxley Anne encountered an awakening moment while observing Cy Twombly’s 1960s painting “Ilium (One Morning Ten Years Later).” The duality of tranquility and intensity in emotional response flooded her senses after contact was made with the painting, bringing back a very critical piece of her life. \"I spent thirty minutes in front of one of his masterpieces, “The Rose,” explains Huxley Anne. \"Turning around, I came face to face with Twombly’s “Ilium (One Morning Ten Years Later),” and in one sublime instant I was overcome with raw emotion, tears bleeding from my eyes with joy and pain and beauty and melancholy and death and desire and the truest feeling I’d been searching for for the past five years. I could feel emotion again and the intensity was overwhelming.\" It had the affect of activating a voyage of artistry that's become lasting fuel in the strength of her soul and the desire to reach from the furthest depths of her creativity to produce art that can live far outside of her reach.\n\n\nWhen diving in even further around the catalyst to Ilium's creation, the biggest influence of the record appears. A few days after Huxley Anne found Cy Twombly’s “Ilium (One Morning Ten Years Later)” , she read an essay that a friend left in her car, discovering a word that took her to the mental, spiritual and physical realms the painting originally evoked: duende. As Huxley Anne further explains, \"Duende loosely means having soul, a heightened state of emotion, expression and authenticity. The duende is the spirit of evocation, it is what comes out from inside you as a physical/emotional response to art. It is what makes you cry or smile or fall to your knees when hearing a concerto or witnessing flamenco in the streets. Federico Garcia Lorca wrote often about this spirit, stating there are key elements involved: irrationality, earthiness, a heightened awareness of death, and a dash of the diabolical. I believe Lorca, the duende is a spirit who helps the artist see the limitations of intelligence, it reminds you a lobster could suddenly fall on your head, bringing the artist face-to-face with death in order to help create and communicate memorable art. The duende is not virtuosity or talent or work. It is a power, a struggle.\"\n\n\nRecordings for Huxley Anne's debut album took form shortly after this experience at the Broad Museum and her newly sparked connection with the force of duende, finding refuge in her home studio in the beginning hours of 2017 with a storm of sonic visions to explore. The act of deep solitude served the writing and recording process in equal measure, giving her ample space to explore the vast world of sounds that were finalized for the album. Sonically, Ilium is an orchestrated field of unique beauty, drawing together eight tracks of exotic electronic music that calls upon the darkest and most light driven of emotions. Exploratory textures take on vortexes of shape through cinematic sound designs, fluidly traversing between amorphous undertones, intricate composition mapping and pulsing rhythms. Electronic music that's sprouted through emotive songwriting and shape-shifting contours, conjoined in the most dynamic of forms and progressions.\n\n\nFrom the submersion of euphoria to the illumination of power, Ilium draws upon as many influences in the realm of mystical antiquity as it does the landscape of experimental music leading us into the future. A sonic portrait of her ascension through creative turmoil, the struggle of sustained determination and a rebirth into timeless artistry. Huxley Anne has created a boldness in sound that was made with the most vulnerable and giving of sides and simply put, Ilium is the continuation of meaningful life.\n\n\nTrack Listing\n1. Slant\n2.

The new record drops worldwide on vinyl and digital platforms August 27th and follows her debut LP Drenched, initially released in March of 2020. Diligently working on her follow-up since last year as the pandemic surged and life continued to transform, QRTR has unloaded a treasure trove of hypnotic grooves that vortex around the many intricacies of her experimental approach and leave testament to her growth as an artist. All tracks were mixed by QRTR and mastered by Ryan Schwabe (Oneohtrix Point Never, Tierra Whack, Shamir, RJD2).\n\nRooted in the transfixing worlds of house, infina ad nausea finds unique deviations, including drum ‘n bass, ambient, classical, and IDM. The record was produced at various home studio locations around Brooklyn, with some of the material dating back to 2017. Field recordings were captured at Notre Dame, Paris in 2018, as well as Catskills, New York in 2020. Every track is filled to the brim with synths, percussion, drums, samples and original vocal parts from QRTR that underscore her range as a producer and arranger. Features include QRTR’s cat companion, the infamous ambientkitty, LA-based electronic producer and vocalist artemis orion, and New York artists Braille, Daniel de Lara, and CSLTY.\n\nMuch like QRTR’s maiden voyage on Dome of Doom, infina ad nausea derives meaning through concept form and the way artistic and personal life collide in the most challenging ways. From the titles and their sonic derivatives, down to the order of the tracks across the LP and how they transition from one song to another, every aspect of the LP is a piece of the puzzle that endlessly spirals over one another. QRTR adds further context, “infina ad nausea is a play on latin terms “ad infinitum” and “ad nauseum.” I was trying to create a phrase to describe growing sick of a false feeling of permanence, as though you're living in a never ending loop. I was steeping in the concept of “spiral” which is a theme I’ve been coming back to constantly in my art and life since 2011. I always felt as though I was living within a series of full circles overlapping on each other (creating the illusion of a spiral). I have a tattoo on my arm that I designed in an effort to visually express the idea. The concept of this album feels a little larger than life to me and difficult to describe and that is exactly what I was trying to encompass sonically. I arranged the track order in a way that felt like the act of spiraling internally (mentally and emotionally). It starts off bright and playful and becomes more frenzied until suddenly you’ve reached “the point” - which is ever moving and evolving and thus unreachable.”\n\ninfina ad nausea is an album full of deep exploration that builds on the level of musicality present on Drenched and raises the bar even higher. Utilizing a palette of different synth tones, rhythm structures, and genre modes from track to track, little pockets become an oasis of sudden bursts, void outs, and all out scenery changes. As the panoramic landscaping of the longer sections leave the soul enthralled, little bits and pieces float everywhere in the mix, capturing endless details as the auditory lens rotates through the mixes. Nothing feels stitched or separated, flowing with a constant state of motion and seamlessness. Forming as chapters, every song has an abundance of meaning and description while tapping into its own special vibe. There are no two-tracks that are exactly alike. The album’s sole interlude, “Nossa,” is one of QRTR’s most expansive and breathtaking works in the ambient field, utilizing vocal choir harmony in a way that feels ancient and experimentally classical. The first half of “Ritual (feat. CSLTY)” is equally riveting and emotionally consuming in the name of ambient music, catapulted into the second section of the piece once the drum ‘n bass rhythm burst. It's a transformation that happens at lightspeed while remaining glued to the original essence with the ongoing overtones.\n\nOn “With You,” QRTR (NY) and artemis orion (LA) conjoin the coastal vibes of the US for one of the lushest grooves of the album, orchestrated with a sense of songwriting that shows their strengths as singular creators and collaborators. The energy of the club wavers with brilliance on album singles “Want Me 2” and “Fractals,” foreshadowing the experiences on the dance floor to come and those that paved the way prior. One of the album's defining connections appears with the bookend effect between the album opener, “The Outer Edge (feat. ambientkitty)” and its counterpart LP closer, “Lucid (feat. Braille).” Both find a way to slip between complex melody layers that bubble around one another and deep swelling experimental build-ups that pull from Pink Floyd-esque synth lines and William Basinski influenced soundscapes. Every track from infina ad nausea gives a new world to explore, adding to the chains of cyclical renewal that flows through the LP.\n\nQRTR is one of electronic music’s brightest upcoming voices and has carved out another important mark in her legacy with infina ad nausea. A work that pushes back on neat packaging and easy access points, standing as an opulently expressive and raw statement that takes into account the full range of human experience.\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1.

The record releases September 25th on Cable's imprint Dome of Doom and is the 8th full-length in his catalog. The compositional formats across the 40 minute album are dense and dynamic, bursting with heavy rhythms, crystalized harmonies, soothing breakdowns, and technical finesse. IDM, downtempo, lofi house, 808 filled trap, LA-centric beats, musique concrète, drum ‘n bass, jungle, modern classical; it’s an encyclopedia of 21st century sound that interlaces Cable’s musical voice with distinction and purpose. In this context, the album acts as one of the artists’ most realized works in musical range. Features across Shimmer, Then Disappear include a number of artists connected to the Dome of Doom family: Holly, Dabow, GOD.DAMN.CHAN, Goodnight Cody, and Call Me. Cable mixed the entire LP, with mastering from Daddy Kev at Cosmic Zoo Studios. Album artwork was completed by Dewey Saunders, an artist internationally known for album cover work with Anderson Paak, Future, Nxworries, Felly, Griz, and more. \n\nThe collaborative recording process and abundance of gear on Shimmer, Then Disappear makes this an album of constant surprises and new revelations on repeated listens. Most sessions were completed at Cable’s home studio in the hills of LA and the gear set-up included a laptop, Ableton, Kitten Octave, Oberheim/Viscount OB-3 Squared, Roland TR-8, Roland JP-08, Critter & Guitari Pocket Piano GR, Arturia Keystep, Moog Sirin, AKG C214, and the AKG C 414 B-ULS. The Roland TR-8 and the Roland JP-08 were both given to Cable on loan by Daedelus right before he set off to Boston for his new position at Berklee on the EDI faculty. Daedelus' only request was that Cable keep making music. Argentina’s Dabow and Portugal’s Holly were both in Los Angeles during the same week last year, creating at Cable’s studio for a day straight and coming up with one of the record’s hardest hitting tracks. Maine’s GOD.DAMN.CHAN also created his two features at Cable’s studio during a trip to the west coast last year, knocking out their collaborations with speed and ferocity. They dive in and out of musical ideas first poured from pioneering and next generation artists across Warp and Ninja Tune. Los Angeles multi-instrumentalist Goodnight Cody was the only musician to record his part outside of Cable’s studio, submitting a solo recording of slide guitar for future processing and reconfiguring. Like many of his records over the years, Cable also adds vox, supplanting lyrics of self-examination and personal perseverance that are some of his most direct and intentional lyrics ever. All collaborations occurred before the COVID-19 pandemic, cementing the structure of the LP well before its eventual release in 2020.\n\nAfter the mental fog created from the world's collective state of social unrest started to slowly subside and the changing landscape within the touring/music industry was adapted to, Cable was able to initiate the second process of the album and flesh out the rest of the music. In March, during the initial shutdowns in Los Angeles, Cable locked himself in his home studio for a period of weeks and began making a new song every day. This would initiate first thing in the morning when he woke up. It happened slowly but it became an important process in finishing the record and creating most of the new solo material. In this process chain of the recording sessions and what was absorbed during those times, the album is a bridge from the world we knew into the world we all live in now. A perfect reflection of the transitional energy that was brought onto the world collectively over the last nine months. Closing the album in a similar fashion to past records with a beatless and sobering piece, the Mac Miller tribute “Mac Flip” was sourced from a sample Cable found online from a Canadian producer by the name Two Swings. It ties in the final scope of the record with a reflection on artistic influence and the value we hold on those who are still here and those who leave us. Labelmate thook, who released his Noise LP on DoD last year, was the one who first showed Cable the track. “I discovered this artist Two Swings from Canada through thook, who released his Noise LP on the label last year. Two Swings had made a song called \"Tribute to Malcolm\" that was released on SoundCloud, and I found it through a repost on thook's account. It's a really beautiful piece and starts with this piano and string section that I used to create my flip of the song. The original version from Two Swings then goes on to drop into a remix with some of Malcolm's vocals, etc. I just clipped the initial few second loop and used it as material to compose new melodies with. I also reached out to Two Swings to get their blessings to use the sample, since it sounded to me like the intro was an original recording. They were down so it ended up on the record.”\n\nConceptually, Shimmer, Then Disappear is presented with an overall flow that connects all titles and thematic song styles as one dynamic story. The creator of this work takes up the lead character role, soul searching as realities start to cave in and exit ramps ensue. Cable elaborates further on the conceptual theme of the album, “The first song is called \"How to Disappear\", the second song is called \"Travel Light'', then the next \"End All Contracts.''  To me, the tracklist reads like a deranged to-do list of this character that is attempting to erase themselves and start a new life. Read chronologically, the track list tells the story of someone attempting to disappear, but coming up against all the pitfalls that, as humans, we all have. \"Contacting People from your Past\", \"The Lure of Personal Success\" and \"Short Game vs Long Game\" all speak to our desires to be connected to others. It is no way natural for us as a species to be isolated or cut off from our family groups, but in our modern world this has increasingly become the case whether we like it or not. I feel like I tell that story most directly on \"Change Your Name\" with the lyrics \"What you see, is what you get, and what if you could change your name? Would you run from your regrets, or would you keep it all the same?\" I guess for me music is always just a time capsule of my life at the time I was making it.” Pacing, peaks, valleys, bursts, the calm; every track follows from one another energetically and offers a personal unpacking of one’s soul. A vulnerability in transmitted reflections that pushes postering and ego to the side.\n\nThe album title for Shimmer, Then Disappear has roots dug into Wylie Cable’s CalArts days in the early 2000s and his initial discovery of the works of Muslimgauze during this time. Wylie pulled the LP's title from a Muslimgauze song of the same name that appears on the 1997 LP Jaal Ab Dullah (Soleilmoon Recordings). “I'm sure the reference will be lost on 99% of people though as Muslimgauze has become a more obscure name in the electronic music collectors world. I personally have been obsessed with his music since college though. My old friend David Cohen introduced me to Muzlimgauze's music in his CalArts sublevel studio in the film department. We used to hang out endlessly and listen to the dudes music trying to figure out how he made all this shit with dub tape loops in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s. I really think you hear a lot of Muslimgauze influence in all of underground bass music, even if it's not a commonly regarded opinion. The guy was making insane distorted 808 breakbeat loops, recording all his own percussion and samples and doing the takes live on a board playing it like an instrument, ala King Tubby and other dub pioneers that advanced music by approaching studio equipment with new ideas that became commonplace later. As far as what the title means to me personally, I feel it's yet another way to look at impermanence, here today, gone tomorrow sort of a thing. My hope is that with my time on the planet I can create some things that are beautiful that remind others that there is wonder and grace and love in human nature... then disappear.”\n\nWhile running Dome of Doom over the last nine years, unfiltered culture has been injected into the underground music community with every release, flipping a staggering 18,000+ cassette tapes since the label's inception. Releasing music on his own label has afforded Cable the creative flexibility to mold his releases in an uncompromised vision and to connect dots that are personalized and true to his goals as a creative artist looking to bring worthwhile change to this world. Shimmer, The Disappear is the ethos of this mission at its core, presenting one-of-a-kind fusions that find their origins as a synthesis of Cable’s time as a classically trained upright bassist and his lifelong experiences within the hip-hop, punk, hardcore, and electronic music communities.\n\n\nTracklisting\n\n1.

But it was more than just the adoration. She knew me better than anyone within five minutes of meeting me.

The new record drops worldwide on vinyl and digital platforms August 27th and follows her debut LP Drenched, initially released in March of 2020. Diligently working on her follow-up since last year as the pandemic surged and life continued to transform, QRTR has unloaded a treasure trove of hypnotic grooves that vortex around the many intricacies of her experimental approach and leave testament to her growth as an artist. All tracks were mixed by QRTR and mastered by Ryan Schwabe (Oneohtrix Point Never, Tierra Whack, Shamir, RJD2).\n\nRooted in the transfixing worlds of house, infina ad nausea finds unique deviations, including drum ‘n bass, ambient, classical, and IDM. The record was produced at various home studio locations around Brooklyn, with some of the material dating back to 2017. Field recordings were captured at Notre Dame, Paris in 2018, as well as Catskills, New York in 2020. Every track is filled to the brim with synths, percussion, drums, samples and original vocal parts from QRTR that underscore her range as a producer and arranger. Features include QRTR’s cat companion, the infamous ambientkitty, LA-based electronic producer and vocalist artemis orion, and New York artists Braille, Daniel de Lara, and CSLTY.\n\nMuch like QRTR’s maiden voyage on Dome of Doom, infina ad nausea derives meaning through concept form and the way artistic and personal life collide in the most challenging ways. From the titles and their sonic derivatives, down to the order of the tracks across the LP and how they transition from one song to another, every aspect of the LP is a piece of the puzzle that endlessly spirals over one another. QRTR adds further context, “infina ad nausea is a play on latin terms “ad infinitum” and “ad nauseum.” I was trying to create a phrase to describe growing sick of a false feeling of permanence, as though you're living in a never ending loop. I was steeping in the concept of “spiral” which is a theme I’ve been coming back to constantly in my art and life since 2011. I always felt as though I was living within a series of full circles overlapping on each other (creating the illusion of a spiral). I have a tattoo on my arm that I designed in an effort to visually express the idea. The concept of this album feels a little larger than life to me and difficult to describe and that is exactly what I was trying to encompass sonically. I arranged the track order in a way that felt like the act of spiraling internally (mentally and emotionally). It starts off bright and playful and becomes more frenzied until suddenly you’ve reached “the point” - which is ever moving and evolving and thus unreachable.”\n\ninfina ad nausea is an album full of deep exploration that builds on the level of musicality present on Drenched and raises the bar even higher. Utilizing a palette of different synth tones, rhythm structures, and genre modes from track to track, little pockets become an oasis of sudden bursts, void outs, and all out scenery changes. As the panoramic landscaping of the longer sections leave the soul enthralled, little bits and pieces float everywhere in the mix, capturing endless details as the auditory lens rotates through the mixes. Nothing feels stitched or separated, flowing with a constant state of motion and seamlessness. Forming as chapters, every song has an abundance of meaning and description while tapping into its own special vibe. There are no two-tracks that are exactly alike. The album’s sole interlude, “Nossa,” is one of QRTR’s most expansive and breathtaking works in the ambient field, utilizing vocal choir harmony in a way that feels ancient and experimentally classical. The first half of “Ritual (feat. CSLTY)” is equally riveting and emotionally consuming in the name of ambient music, catapulted into the second section of the piece once the drum ‘n bass rhythm burst. It's a transformation that happens at lightspeed while remaining glued to the original essence with the ongoing overtones.\n\nOn “With You,” QRTR (NY) and artemis orion (LA) conjoin the coastal vibes of the US for one of the lushest grooves of the album, orchestrated with a sense of songwriting that shows their strengths as singular creators and collaborators. The energy of the club wavers with brilliance on album singles “Want Me 2” and “Fractals,” foreshadowing the experiences on the dance floor to come and those that paved the way prior. One of the album's defining connections appears with the bookend effect between the album opener, “The Outer Edge (feat. ambientkitty)” and its counterpart LP closer, “Lucid (feat. Braille).” Both find a way to slip between complex melody layers that bubble around one another and deep swelling experimental build-ups that pull from Pink Floyd-esque synth lines and William Basinski influenced soundscapes. Every track from infina ad nausea gives a new world to explore, adding to the chains of cyclical renewal that flows through the LP.\n\nQRTR is one of electronic music’s brightest upcoming voices and has carved out another important mark in her legacy with infina ad nausea. A work that pushes back on neat packaging and easy access points, standing as an opulently expressive and raw statement that takes into account the full range of human experience.\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1.

It was fall and I was in Malibu making Whethan's album Fantasy with a few of my closest friends. We didn't really see anyone else for a few weeks, some days we'd work on the songs together, others we'd all contribute separately and intermittently check in on each other's progress. Every day was pretty much exclusively filled up with Fantasy, but towards the end of the retreat we had gotten a general layout of the album and decided to take a 24 hour break to reset and check back in the following day with fresh ears.\n\nIn the morning, I decided to take some mushrooms and meditate. The house was this Mediterranean palace placed right on the edge of a mountain, overlooking the ocean with a sprawling backyard. I sat myself in the grass and closed my eyes, just as the shrooms started hitting. I got a little anxious about thirty minutes in, but this voice in my head started softly repeating \"surrender to the moment, stop trying to control it\" and when i listened, it brought me a peace that had a melody attached to it. Ten minutes later I'd written deep breath in the sun, and that little mantra repeating in my head can be heard in the outro of it. \n\ni got really emotional after laying deep breath down. i couldn't stop crying thinking about my mom, and how i probably would never know how it felt to be a mother looking at their child. images of me as a baby in a sea of sheets, her gentle voice lulling me to sleep were clear in my head, it all felt so profound. i heard in my head what i thought it must have felt like to be her, tender and fragile but also unshakable and unequivocally deep. i ran inside with tears still in my eyes, sat at the grand piano, and recorded what became do you know how much i love you. to this day i regard it as the most powerful piece of music i've ever made.\n\nAt sunset, we drove down to the beach and i hopped in the water as the sun went down. The image used for this piece was a super8 frame from that moment. Everything was so beautiful. I was with some of my best friends of my entire life, swimming in southern california, and had just made two of my favorite songs ever. We went back up to the house and in the glow of twilight i hopped on a trampoline at a property across the street with my friend Tak taking photos on his Contax. That's where the album cover art came from. \n\nAn hour later the sun had gone down and I was sitting on the floor of wheaty's room playing guitar. I was still pretty high when a full blood moon started rising up out of the ocean, running a glowing red streak across its surface. I felt so connected to the universe at that moment I swore I could hear it talking to me, and I went outside with a couple of buddies and started just howling. I went back inside, picked up the guitar, and tracked the first half of can you hear the moon sat down on the floor. I met everyone downstairs for dinner, talked a while and went back upstairs and finished it.\n\nAfter we'd left Malibu I realized just how much those songs meant to me, and how much sense they made together. So I made them flow nicely into one another, polished them up individually, and turned it over to the world as The In Between.\n\nI hope that this body of work has or does resonate with you as much as it has for me.\n\nThe winner of this piece will receive:\n\n- (2) VIP tickets to any non-private/festival Grady shows in perpetuity\n- Access to a token gated archive of demos/ future releases by Grady via $LOVE tokens\n- The In Between signed poster\n- The  In Between t-shirt\n- The In Between .jpeg file\n- The In Between .wav file\n\n25% of all secondary sales will go to a non-profit voted by $LOVE token holders.","project":null,"title":"The In Between","trackNumber":null,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0x575c57cb1549a8e19aed71e25e6fa33ad9343d6ad637c561d1114b5c06a49af661dbd63b570d8d845e83c1df827a2b504525d166b9743d53c0803393513071dc1c","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"},"name":"The In Between","description":"This project was made over the course of 14 hours two years ago and it changed my life forever.

It benefited so much from Joel Ford’s (who mixed the record) guidance. When I first sent him the original demos he said he could hear slivers of “early 2000s French house music”, even though I was hearing was colder, more modular-based synth sounds.

Being involved in Caribbean festivities like the Labor day parade shaped our summers. People are playing mass and repping their camps. Jab Jabs roaming the streets during Jouvert night. Flags and costumes can be seen everywhere.  This was Summer in the BK.  \n\n     I moved to LA in 2016 and began to reminisce on my upbringing in East Flatbush, Brooklyn.  The nostalgia inspired so much work. I tapped more and more into my Jamican roots. Throughout this process, I wrote everything I was feeling. Some of my feelings were expressed through songs, apps, and films, while others came through as writings, digital art and spiritual awakenings. \n\n     In 2015 I started creating a beat and demo that would became Warrior Song. I began playing it around at parties. I directed a video in 2017 with a friend and long time collaborator Jason Banker. I wrote songs in Jamaica for the first time and collaborated with Shungudzo. \n\n     I also worked on myself. I opened up to friends and family more and felt the spirit of my ancestors resonating through all of my music from day one. \n\nI'm grateful for every lesson learned in the process. \n\n     Warrior Song is featured on Big Chunez Vol.1, an Album I wanted to release back in 2017, but the alignment was incorrect.  I created artwork, videos and commissioned some of my favorite artists and directors to help craft a visual representation of the music that felt exactly like what the listener would experience.\n\n     I put so much honest, creative, spiritual, and magical energy into warrior song I genuinely feel that the reward for me here is having this song out in the world and on  WEb3 for the first time.

Being involved in Caribbean festivities like the Labor day parade shaped our summers. People are playing mass and repping their camps. Jab Jabs roaming the streets during Jouvert night. Flags and costumes can be seen everywhere.  This was Summer in the BK.  \n\n     I moved to LA in 2016 and began to reminisce on my upbringing in East Flatbush, Brooklyn.  The nostalgia inspired so much work. I tapped more and more into my Jamican roots. Throughout this process, I wrote everything I was feeling. Some of my feelings were expressed through songs, apps, and films, while others came through as writings, digital art and spiritual awakenings. \n\n     In 2015 I started creating a beat and demo that would became Warrior Song. I began playing it around at parties. I directed a video in 2017 with a friend and long time collaborator Jason Banker. I wrote songs in Jamaica for the first time and collaborated with Shungudzo. \n\n     I also worked on myself. I opened up to friends and family more and felt the spirit of my ancestors resonating through all of my music from day one. \n\nI'm grateful for every lesson learned in the process. \n\n     Warrior Song is featured on Big Chunez Vol.1, an Album I wanted to release back in 2017, but the alignment was incorrect.  I created artwork, videos and commissioned some of my favorite artists and directors to help craft a visual representation of the music that felt exactly like what the listener would experience.\n\n     I put so much honest, creative, spiritual, and magical energy into warrior song I genuinely feel that the reward for me here is having this song out in the world and on  WEb3 for the first time. That alone makes me happy. So much power came from creating this song.  I know it's because the intent and purpose of this record is to show respect and love to the warrior spirit.  The DNA of the original peoples' resonants in all we do, whether we acknowledge it or not. \n\n     Each year Caribbean centered carnivals are celebrated worldwide by those who know the history and many who don't. With respect to the resilient spirit of peoples of the Caribbean and African diaspora world wide.

The new record drops worldwide on vinyl and digital platforms August 27th and follows her debut LP Drenched, initially released in March of 2020. Diligently working on her follow-up since last year as the pandemic surged and life continued to transform, QRTR has unloaded a treasure trove of hypnotic grooves that vortex around the many intricacies of her experimental approach and leave testament to her growth as an artist. All tracks were mixed by QRTR and mastered by Ryan Schwabe (Oneohtrix Point Never, Tierra Whack, Shamir, RJD2).\n\nRooted in the transfixing worlds of house, infina ad nausea finds unique deviations, including drum ‘n bass, ambient, classical, and IDM. The record was produced at various home studio locations around Brooklyn, with some of the material dating back to 2017. Field recordings were captured at Notre Dame, Paris in 2018, as well as Catskills, New York in 2020. Every track is filled to the brim with synths, percussion, drums, samples and original vocal parts from QRTR that underscore her range as a producer and arranger. Features include QRTR’s cat companion, the infamous ambientkitty, LA-based electronic producer and vocalist artemis orion, and New York artists Braille, Daniel de Lara, and CSLTY.\n\nMuch like QRTR’s maiden voyage on Dome of Doom, infina ad nausea derives meaning through concept form and the way artistic and personal life collide in the most challenging ways. From the titles and their sonic derivatives, down to the order of the tracks across the LP and how they transition from one song to another, every aspect of the LP is a piece of the puzzle that endlessly spirals over one another. QRTR adds further context, “infina ad nausea is a play on latin terms “ad infinitum” and “ad nauseum.” I was trying to create a phrase to describe growing sick of a false feeling of permanence, as though you're living in a never ending loop. I was steeping in the concept of “spiral” which is a theme I’ve been coming back to constantly in my art and life since 2011. I always felt as though I was living within a series of full circles overlapping on each other (creating the illusion of a spiral). I have a tattoo on my arm that I designed in an effort to visually express the idea. The concept of this album feels a little larger than life to me and difficult to describe and that is exactly what I was trying to encompass sonically. I arranged the track order in a way that felt like the act of spiraling internally (mentally and emotionally). It starts off bright and playful and becomes more frenzied until suddenly you’ve reached “the point” - which is ever moving and evolving and thus unreachable.”\n\ninfina ad nausea is an album full of deep exploration that builds on the level of musicality present on Drenched and raises the bar even higher. Utilizing a palette of different synth tones, rhythm structures, and genre modes from track to track, little pockets become an oasis of sudden bursts, void outs, and all out scenery changes. As the panoramic landscaping of the longer sections leave the soul enthralled, little bits and pieces float everywhere in the mix, capturing endless details as the auditory lens rotates through the mixes. Nothing feels stitched or separated, flowing with a constant state of motion and seamlessness. Forming as chapters, every song has an abundance of meaning and description while tapping into its own special vibe. There are no two-tracks that are exactly alike. The album’s sole interlude, “Nossa,” is one of QRTR’s most expansive and breathtaking works in the ambient field, utilizing vocal choir harmony in a way that feels ancient and experimentally classical. The first half of “Ritual (feat. CSLTY)” is equally riveting and emotionally consuming in the name of ambient music, catapulted into the second section of the piece once the drum ‘n bass rhythm burst. It's a transformation that happens at lightspeed while remaining glued to the original essence with the ongoing overtones.\n\nOn “With You,” QRTR (NY) and artemis orion (LA) conjoin the coastal vibes of the US for one of the lushest grooves of the album, orchestrated with a sense of songwriting that shows their strengths as singular creators and collaborators. The energy of the club wavers with brilliance on album singles “Want Me 2” and “Fractals,” foreshadowing the experiences on the dance floor to come and those that paved the way prior. One of the album's defining connections appears with the bookend effect between the album opener, “The Outer Edge (feat. ambientkitty)” and its counterpart LP closer, “Lucid (feat. Braille).” Both find a way to slip between complex melody layers that bubble around one another and deep swelling experimental build-ups that pull from Pink Floyd-esque synth lines and William Basinski influenced soundscapes. Every track from infina ad nausea gives a new world to explore, adding to the chains of cyclical renewal that flows through the LP.\n\nQRTR is one of electronic music’s brightest upcoming voices and has carved out another important mark in her legacy with infina ad nausea. A work that pushes back on neat packaging and easy access points, standing as an opulently expressive and raw statement that takes into account the full range of human experience.\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1.

The new record drops worldwide on vinyl and digital platforms August 27th and follows her debut LP Drenched, initially released in March of 2020. Diligently working on her follow-up since last year as the pandemic surged and life continued to transform, QRTR has unloaded a treasure trove of hypnotic grooves that vortex around the many intricacies of her experimental approach and leave testament to her growth as an artist. All tracks were mixed by QRTR and mastered by Ryan Schwabe (Oneohtrix Point Never, Tierra Whack, Shamir, RJD2).\n\nRooted in the transfixing worlds of house, infina ad nausea finds unique deviations, including drum ‘n bass, ambient, classical, and IDM. The record was produced at various home studio locations around Brooklyn, with some of the material dating back to 2017. Field recordings were captured at Notre Dame, Paris in 2018, as well as Catskills, New York in 2020. Every track is filled to the brim with synths, percussion, drums, samples and original vocal parts from QRTR that underscore her range as a producer and arranger. Features include QRTR’s cat companion, the infamous ambientkitty, LA-based electronic producer and vocalist artemis orion, and New York artists Braille, Daniel de Lara, and CSLTY.\n\nMuch like QRTR’s maiden voyage on Dome of Doom, infina ad nausea derives meaning through concept form and the way artistic and personal life collide in the most challenging ways. From the titles and their sonic derivatives, down to the order of the tracks across the LP and how they transition from one song to another, every aspect of the LP is a piece of the puzzle that endlessly spirals over one another. QRTR adds further context, “infina ad nausea is a play on latin terms “ad infinitum” and “ad nauseum.” I was trying to create a phrase to describe growing sick of a false feeling of permanence, as though you're living in a never ending loop. I was steeping in the concept of “spiral” which is a theme I’ve been coming back to constantly in my art and life since 2011. I always felt as though I was living within a series of full circles overlapping on each other (creating the illusion of a spiral). I have a tattoo on my arm that I designed in an effort to visually express the idea. The concept of this album feels a little larger than life to me and difficult to describe and that is exactly what I was trying to encompass sonically. I arranged the track order in a way that felt like the act of spiraling internally (mentally and emotionally). It starts off bright and playful and becomes more frenzied until suddenly you’ve reached “the point” - which is ever moving and evolving and thus unreachable.”\n\ninfina ad nausea is an album full of deep exploration that builds on the level of musicality present on Drenched and raises the bar even higher. Utilizing a palette of different synth tones, rhythm structures, and genre modes from track to track, little pockets become an oasis of sudden bursts, void outs, and all out scenery changes. As the panoramic landscaping of the longer sections leave the soul enthralled, little bits and pieces float everywhere in the mix, capturing endless details as the auditory lens rotates through the mixes. Nothing feels stitched or separated, flowing with a constant state of motion and seamlessness. Forming as chapters, every song has an abundance of meaning and description while tapping into its own special vibe. There are no two-tracks that are exactly alike. The album’s sole interlude, “Nossa,” is one of QRTR’s most expansive and breathtaking works in the ambient field, utilizing vocal choir harmony in a way that feels ancient and experimentally classical. The first half of “Ritual (feat. CSLTY)” is equally riveting and emotionally consuming in the name of ambient music, catapulted into the second section of the piece once the drum ‘n bass rhythm burst. It's a transformation that happens at lightspeed while remaining glued to the original essence with the ongoing overtones.\n\nOn “With You,” QRTR (NY) and artemis orion (LA) conjoin the coastal vibes of the US for one of the lushest grooves of the album, orchestrated with a sense of songwriting that shows their strengths as singular creators and collaborators. The energy of the club wavers with brilliance on album singles “Want Me 2” and “Fractals,” foreshadowing the experiences on the dance floor to come and those that paved the way prior. One of the album's defining connections appears with the bookend effect between the album opener, “The Outer Edge (feat. ambientkitty)” and its counterpart LP closer, “Lucid (feat. Braille).” Both find a way to slip between complex melody layers that bubble around one another and deep swelling experimental build-ups that pull from Pink Floyd-esque synth lines and William Basinski influenced soundscapes. Every track from infina ad nausea gives a new world to explore, adding to the chains of cyclical renewal that flows through the LP.\n\nQRTR is one of electronic music’s brightest upcoming voices and has carved out another important mark in her legacy with infina ad nausea. A work that pushes back on neat packaging and easy access points, standing as an opulently expressive and raw statement that takes into account the full range of human experience.\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1.

This general theme came from the realization that, as humans, we all have our own inner demons and insecurities to deal with, stemming from a combination of factors, such as societal norms, mental health issues, genetic predispositions, etc…, but there’s still a social stigma surrounding vulnerability and insecurity. With Hvdson being a genderless, raceless, and faceless entity with a mirrored mask, this creates separation from the listener and audience, and allows people to project themselves onto the character.

The advent of hyperconnectivity gives us instant access to almost anyone or anything in the world. Even some relationships are built through online personas, some never coming into fruition. With technological advancements, we are able to create perfect online personas - a projection of our perfect image. But perhaps in this pursuit, we distance ourselves further from reality. This will be criticised through a “paradoxical superhero”; though Hvdson appears to have the external look of a powerful being, the character and persona of Hvdson will be sensitive, powerless and fragile. The album plays with this idea through the use of auto-tune and pitch correction. On the listener’s journey, at the beginning, the vocals are manipulated and corrected very obviously, as a crude attempt to cover up imperfection. But as the album progresses, the use of pitch correction and vocal manipulation is minimized, and symbolizes Hvdson coming to terms with the idea that nothing can ever be perfect.","title":"In Security"},"title":"Understand","trackNumber":3,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0xa90c1be7cd1acc6103c674489d593516e7e0cbe377cccaeafc77a659deb114224e2099cb9cab72da7ea1050725808694272733821669a102fc6c7e1b8ed937b11c","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"},"name":"Understand","description":"It’s been 2 years since this project has been released (11/22/2019) but I didn’t get a proper chance to fully push it out (RIP pandemic) - this new paradigm and wave of music NFTs seems like the perfect opportunity to push this project out again.\n\nWith Catalog being at the forefront of 1/1 canonical music NFTs and my involvement as one of the founding core engineers, it makes sense to post on Catalog as this is what I am capable of doing entirely myself as an auteur of music.\n\nI’ve played, composed, recorded, wrote, produced, mixed and mastered music my whole life and this is the first project that I’ve been satisfied enough with to call my magnum opus.\n\nThis was the first full project I've released as Hvdson being a masked alias back in 2019 - the genesis project.

This general theme came from the realization that, as humans, we all have our own inner demons and insecurities to deal with, stemming from a combination of factors, such as societal norms, mental health issues, genetic predispositions, etc…, but there’s still a social stigma surrounding vulnerability and insecurity. With Hvdson being a genderless, raceless, and faceless entity with a mirrored mask, this creates separation from the listener and audience, and allows people to project themselves onto the character. Though the character I am trying to convey through Hvdson is essentially ‘not human’, the underlying, fundamental truth coming from the music touches upon a common emotion that has recently been more prominent in the information age - loneliness. The advent of hyperconnectivity gives us instant access to almost anyone or anything in the world. Even some relationships are built through online personas, some never coming into fruition. With technological advancements, we are able to create perfect online personas - a projection of our perfect image. But perhaps in this pursuit, we distance ourselves further from reality. This will be criticised through a “paradoxical superhero”; though Hvdson appears to have the external look of a powerful being, the character and persona of Hvdson will be sensitive, powerless and fragile. The album plays with this idea through the use of auto-tune and pitch correction. On the listener’s journey, at the beginning, the vocals are manipulated and corrected very obviously, as a crude attempt to cover up imperfection.

But as the album progresses, the use of pitch correction and vocal manipulation is minimized, and symbolizes Hvdson coming to terms with the idea that nothing can ever be perfect.","title":"In Security"},"title":"For Myself","trackNumber":4,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0x66d907e097c816e094f09a30b086ded11b09ab2a5d02a1cbc44a1721cd0a461612961c57f550d9ebb1f44e98d9da329fc45252e873ed2f49981c7913637f8c701b","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"},"name":"For Myself","description":"It’s been 2 years since this project has been released (11/22/2019) but I didn’t get a proper chance to fully push it out (RIP pandemic) - this new paradigm and wave of music NFTs seems like the perfect opportunity to push this project out again.\n\nWith Catalog being at the forefront of 1/1 canonical music NFTs and my involvement as one of the founding core engineers, it makes sense to post on Catalog as this is what I am capable of doing entirely myself as an auteur of music.\n\nI’ve played, composed, recorded, wrote, produced, mixed and mastered music my whole life and this is the first project that I’ve been satisfied enough with to call my magnum opus.\n\nThis was the first full project I've released as Hvdson being a masked alias back in 2019 - the genesis project. I've always had a vision of making Hvdson this artist that everyone could feel like they were a part of so I tried my best to keep Hvdson a blank slate and make the narrative of a simulation of the persona/ego as inspired by the psychology of Carl Jung's id, ego and super-ego.\n\nI guess the closest thing to what i'm thinking of is what Brud is doing with (Lil) Miquela and the already well known digital persona of Hatsune Miku, but a decentralized and white-labeled version of that in which people own a part of Hvdson and can use it as a composable base layer to build other projects on top of - a decentralized musical persona simulation.\n\nThe vision is to have Hvdson perform at a stadium full of people - all of which have either been contributors of the project or own some portion of it."},"address":"0xabefbc9fd2f806065b4f3c237d4b59d9a97bcac7","tokenId":"6302"},"manifestations":[{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://neume.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeie5b3tlqc3xosyttktlwygub4nu2wcjh3rymhdhevmbhdicdta5qm"},{"version":"0.1.0"}]}

This general theme came from the realization that, as humans, we all have our own inner demons and insecurities to deal with, stemming from a combination of factors, such as societal norms, mental health issues, genetic predispositions, etc…, but there’s still a social stigma surrounding vulnerability and insecurity. With Hvdson being a genderless, raceless, and faceless entity with a mirrored mask, this creates separation from the listener and audience, and allows people to project themselves onto the character. Though the character I am trying to convey through Hvdson is essentially ‘not human’, the underlying, fundamental truth coming from the music touches upon a common emotion that has recently been more prominent in the information age - loneliness. The advent of hyperconnectivity gives us instant access to almost anyone or anything in the world. Even some relationships are built through online personas, some never coming into fruition. With technological advancements, we are able to create perfect online personas - a projection of our perfect image. But perhaps in this pursuit, we distance ourselves further from reality. This will be criticised through a “paradoxical superhero”; though Hvdson appears to have the external look of a powerful being, the character and persona of Hvdson will be sensitive, powerless and fragile. The album plays with this idea through the use of auto-tune and pitch correction. On the listener’s journey, at the beginning, the vocals are manipulated and corrected very obviously, as a crude attempt to cover up imperfection. But as the album progresses, the use of pitch correction and vocal manipulation is minimized, and symbolizes Hvdson coming to terms with the idea that nothing can ever be perfect.","title":"In Security"},"title":"Cross My Mind","trackNumber":5,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0x16bf0c159ab0b4deedd6241481de992db37f4ac0b773ed6d397f684a54c4b7d20c5f7039b2a6bc48dc1d41a8bb1838ee551f76c1b1ddf810e787e532031ce9021c","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"},"name":"Cross My Mind","description":"It’s been 2 years since this project has been released (11/22/2019) but I didn’t get a proper chance to fully push it out (RIP pandemic) - this new paradigm and wave of music NFTs seems like the perfect opportunity to push this project out again.\n\nWith Catalog being at the forefront of 1/1 canonical music NFTs and my involvement as one of the founding core engineers, it makes sense to post on Catalog as this is what I am capable of doing entirely myself as an auteur of music.\n\nI’ve played, composed, recorded, wrote, produced, mixed and mastered music my whole life and this is the first project that I’ve been satisfied enough with to call my magnum opus.\n\nThis was the first full project I've released as Hvdson being a masked alias back in 2019 - the genesis project.

The new record drops worldwide on vinyl and digital platforms August 27th and follows her debut LP Drenched, initially released in March of 2020. Diligently working on her follow-up since last year as the pandemic surged and life continued to transform, QRTR has unloaded a treasure trove of hypnotic grooves that vortex around the many intricacies of her experimental approach and leave testament to her growth as an artist. All tracks were mixed by QRTR and mastered by Ryan Schwabe (Oneohtrix Point Never, Tierra Whack, Shamir, RJD2).\n\nRooted in the transfixing worlds of house, infina ad nausea finds unique deviations, including drum ‘n bass, ambient, classical, and IDM. The record was produced at various home studio locations around Brooklyn, with some of the material dating back to 2017. Field recordings were captured at Notre Dame, Paris in 2018, as well as Catskills, New York in 2020. Every track is filled to the brim with synths, percussion, drums, samples and original vocal parts from QRTR that underscore her range as a producer and arranger. Features include QRTR’s cat companion, the infamous ambientkitty, LA-based electronic producer and vocalist artemis orion, and New York artists Braille, Daniel de Lara, and CSLTY.\n\nMuch like QRTR’s maiden voyage on Dome of Doom, infina ad nausea derives meaning through concept form and the way artistic and personal life collide in the most challenging ways. From the titles and their sonic derivatives, down to the order of the tracks across the LP and how they transition from one song to another, every aspect of the LP is a piece of the puzzle that endlessly spirals over one another. QRTR adds further context, “infina ad nausea is a play on latin terms “ad infinitum” and “ad nauseum.” I was trying to create a phrase to describe growing sick of a false feeling of permanence, as though you're living in a never ending loop. I was steeping in the concept of “spiral” which is a theme I’ve been coming back to constantly in my art and life since 2011. I always felt as though I was living within a series of full circles overlapping on each other (creating the illusion of a spiral). I have a tattoo on my arm that I designed in an effort to visually express the idea. The concept of this album feels a little larger than life to me and difficult to describe and that is exactly what I was trying to encompass sonically. I arranged the track order in a way that felt like the act of spiraling internally (mentally and emotionally). It starts off bright and playful and becomes more frenzied until suddenly you’ve reached “the point” - which is ever moving and evolving and thus unreachable.”\n\ninfina ad nausea is an album full of deep exploration that builds on the level of musicality present on Drenched and raises the bar even higher. Utilizing a palette of different synth tones, rhythm structures, and genre modes from track to track, little pockets become an oasis of sudden bursts, void outs, and all out scenery changes. As the panoramic landscaping of the longer sections leave the soul enthralled, little bits and pieces float everywhere in the mix, capturing endless details as the auditory lens rotates through the mixes. Nothing feels stitched or separated, flowing with a constant state of motion and seamlessness. Forming as chapters, every song has an abundance of meaning and description while tapping into its own special vibe. There are no two-tracks that are exactly alike. The album’s sole interlude, “Nossa,” is one of QRTR’s most expansive and breathtaking works in the ambient field, utilizing vocal choir harmony in a way that feels ancient and experimentally classical. The first half of “Ritual (feat. CSLTY)” is equally riveting and emotionally consuming in the name of ambient music, catapulted into the second section of the piece once the drum ‘n bass rhythm burst. It's a transformation that happens at lightspeed while remaining glued to the original essence with the ongoing overtones.\n\nOn “With You,” QRTR (NY) and artemis orion (LA) conjoin the coastal vibes of the US for one of the lushest grooves of the album, orchestrated with a sense of songwriting that shows their strengths as singular creators and collaborators. The energy of the club wavers with brilliance on album singles “Want Me 2” and “Fractals,” foreshadowing the experiences on the dance floor to come and those that paved the way prior. One of the album's defining connections appears with the bookend effect between the album opener, “The Outer Edge (feat. ambientkitty)” and its counterpart LP closer, “Lucid (feat. Braille).” Both find a way to slip between complex melody layers that bubble around one another and deep swelling experimental build-ups that pull from Pink Floyd-esque synth lines and William Basinski influenced soundscapes. Every track from infina ad nausea gives a new world to explore, adding to the chains of cyclical renewal that flows through the LP.\n\nQRTR is one of electronic music’s brightest upcoming voices and has carved out another important mark in her legacy with infina ad nausea. A work that pushes back on neat packaging and easy access points, standing as an opulently expressive and raw statement that takes into account the full range of human experience.\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1.

It may have an order, but it has no hierarchy; it is not ordered by levels; it is not disordered, either. … If it is an opera, it depends upon constant observation that has neither a score nor an ending, and it is never performed twice on the same stage. If there is no frame, no goal, no direction, we have to consider Gaia as the name of the process by which variable and contingent occurrences have made later events more probable. In this sense, Gaia is a creature no more of chance than of necessity.

My most honest.” The EP exemplifies this by opening with “an audio play on maintaining the balances between one’s relationships and how communication and love from within is key” before diving into the rest of the project. By its conclusion, the listener unveils both a new sound from the producer (i.e. the title track) and songs like “Crazy”, which represent the sound that Lakim’s audience fell in love with. Nightfall represents the producer’s growth since the release of \"This Is Her\", and proves itself as an expansive EP that will satisfy both his current and new wave of listeners.","title":"Nightfall"},"title":"Within You (alternate take)","trackNumber":3,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0x665ed0ccea49006f02e96ef8ef65daf552fb14ea139fff8854227f457f3b140f14b2810b0784f27013a46b08c2a06e181f75178cbae525ca155ec502055e201a1b","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"},"name":"Within You (alternate take)","description":"This is an alternate version of a track I previously released on an EP entitled \"Nightfall\" in 2018.

It follows my thought process through making that decision, and the realities that the choice came with. Coming from a South Asian household, doing music full time has never been an acceptable career path for me, so the day I decided that I would be taking a year to spend on music I was internally torn. Part of me felt disappointed that I would be letting my family down through this decision. Another part of me felt called to do so and was totally convinced of the necessity of the decision. During that year, I went through my highest highs and lowest lows. Some days were incredible, and once I even got an incredibly supportive and affirming phone call from one of my musical idols at 1:30 AM. Other days were not, and I’ve spent my fair share of days in the fetal position after particularly tough conversations with family members.

It follows my thought process through making that decision, and the realities that the choice came with. Coming from a South Asian household, doing music full time has never been an acceptable career path for me, so the day I decided that I would be taking a year to spend on music I was internally torn. Part of me felt disappointed that I would be letting my family down through this decision. Another part of me felt called to do so and was totally convinced of the necessity of the decision. During that year, I went through my highest highs and lowest lows. Some days were incredible, and once I even got an incredibly supportive and affirming phone call from one of my musical idols at 1:30 AM. Other days were not, and I’ve spent my fair share of days in the fetal position after particularly tough conversations with family members. I also was driving Postmates delivery 6-11 hours a day, 6 days a week over the course of the year.

A few days before the pandemic started in the US, I was running a producer challenge with hundreds of artists from around the world to create 5 new songs in five days, and to see what was possible when we set aside our excuses and doubts for a week and just focused on creating. As the world began to shut down and familiar structures fell apart, I decided to keep this pattern going and create one new idea per day for as many days as I could sustain. This practice was my unshakeable rock, and my online music community was (and still is) my lifeline throughout the pandemic. After producing 75 new beats in 50 days, I chose 16 of my favorites to polish up and ultimately become this album. \r\n\r\nThe past few years have exposed so many gaps and wounds on socioeconomic and environmental levels that have been widening and festering for centuries. While making music in reaction to the magnitude of problems and suffering that our world faces seems trivial in many ways, I have faith in the forces of art and sound to create lasting structural changes and profoundly influence our societies. Though small in scale, personally communicating through this medium seemed like one of the best uses of my time during a period where so much other activity has been restricted. \r\n\r\nIt is my greatest hope that this music can inspire others to show up for what they believe in every single day of their lives, come rain or shine. Our planet is in desperate need of allies and warriors to look after its healing and the wellbeing of its inhabitants, as we are all in a collective need of \"life support\" throughout all structures of our existence. I hope that each of us can bring our unique spectrum of gifts to the table in the seasons ahead, knowing that there is strength in numbers and immeasurable positive impact that radiates through each small act of love and creativity.","title":"Life Support"},"title":"do you","trackNumber":5,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0x47d724cfe9bef13b0bbd5b80c57276e639d72254e86d227bbe627214a5b58d14750ad1dc1607f8097c30e8fe222e76aa95928a146547f60a704349b12221c90f1b","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"},"name":"do you","description":"\"do you\" is the fifth track from my breakthrough album \"Life Support,\" as well as the very first NFT of the Dot catalogue. \r\n\r\nIncluded in the first auction is a signed copy of the limited edition vinyl (only 500 records made).\r\n\r\nDot NFT holders gain access to exclusive listening parties and online events for new releases coming later this year.

The release of this project marks a huge milestone for us after it took about a year and a half straight of cataloging songs and discovering exactly who we want to be as a band. Not only considering sonics, but everything in between from our mission, image, and foundational goals. It took blood, sweat, and many tears to get exactly what we were looking for from this project, and with the executive production help of Fever 333 frontman, Jason Aalon Butler, as well as some production love from My Chemical Romance, and Green Day’s long time producer, Rob Cavallo, we were able to give BOYS DO CRY the legs it needed to run. \r\n\r\nWhat the phrase “boys do cry” means to us is that we often are told the right answer is to suck it up and not let your emotions drive you. While this may work for some, we feel that sometimes, it is okay to pause, and cry… before you keep going. Showing emotions can be something we as a culture shy away from, which makes us want to put our flag in the sand and say “hey, we struggle with this shit too, we cry, and that’s okay if you do as well”.

The release of this project marks a huge milestone for us after it took about a year and a half straight of cataloging songs and discovering exactly who we want to be as a band. Not only considering sonics, but everything in between from our mission, image, and foundational goals. It took blood, sweat, and many tears to get exactly what we were looking for from this project. With the executive production help of Fever 333 frontman, Jason Aalon Butler, as well as some production love from My Chemical Romance, and Green Day’s long time producer, Rob Cavallo, we were able to give BOYS DO CRY the legs it needed to run. \r\n\r\nWhat the phrase “boys do cry” means to us is that we often are told the right answer is to suck it up and not let your emotions drive you. While this may work for some, we feel that sometimes, it is okay to pause, and cry… before you keep going. Showing emotions can be something we as a culture shy away from, which makes us want to put our flag in the sand and say “hey, we struggle with this shit too, we cry, and that’s okay if you do as well”. We are all in this weird little life together, let’s love, support, and lift eachother up. It’s okay to feel the way you do.","title":"BOYS DO CRY"},"title":"Slipping Away","trackNumber":1,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0x8597596d25c7a1e4bd27e5c5b26f5dd21a803375bd31689c606075d938675f487ec480401a5c0ae492c547e1d49e9017a9954dade09e99e53ef17fbad09e38e21b","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"},"name":"Slipping Away","description":"The owner of this NFT will receive:\r\n\r\nThe master .wav file of the song\r\nThe master.jpeg of the EP cover art\r\nThe mixed stems for the master project\r\n1 All Access Pass + 1 to any BSD show annually airdropped (not including festivals)\r\n1/1 Custom leather jacket with colors and symbols of your choosing\r\nA special thanks for being the owner of a BOYS DO CRY NFT, 1000 Dropout ($DRPT) Token airdrop \r\nAccess to a token gated portal of unreleased demos and an Alpha Channel in our Discord.\r\n\r\n50% of this NFT's proceeds will be allocated to our community treasury that will eventually provide liquidity for our $DRPT Token and other community endeavors. \r\n10% of all secondary NFT sale royalties will be allocated to the community treasury."},"address":"0xabefbc9fd2f806065b4f3c237d4b59d9a97bcac7","tokenId":"7878"},"manifestations":[{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://neume.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeig5qidbwsognigvdwm5sviktos3kpfvgt46yajrekeow7c6636pfy"},{"version":"0.1.0"}]}

A few days before the pandemic started in the US, I was running a producer challenge with hundreds of artists from around the world to create 5 new songs in five days, and to see what was possible when we set aside our excuses and doubts for a week and just focused on creating. As the world began to shut down and familiar structures fell apart, I decided to keep this pattern going and create one new idea per day for as many days as I could sustain. This practice was my unshakeable rock, and my online music community was (and still is) my lifeline throughout the pandemic. After producing 75 new beats in 50 days, I chose 16 of my favorites to polish up and ultimately become this album. \r\n\r\nThe past few years have exposed so many gaps and wounds on socioeconomic and environmental levels that have been widening and festering for centuries. While making music in reaction to the magnitude of problems and suffering that our world faces seems trivial in many ways, I have faith in the forces of art and sound to create lasting structural changes and profoundly influence our societies. Though small in scale, personally communicating through this medium seemed like one of the best uses of my time during a period where so much other activity has been restricted. \r\n\r\nIt is my greatest hope that this music can inspire others to show up for what they believe in every single day of their lives, come rain or shine. Our planet is in desperate need of allies and warriors to look after its healing and the wellbeing of its inhabitants, as we are all in a collective need of \"life support\" throughout all structures of our existence. I hope that each of us can bring our unique spectrum of gifts to the table in the seasons ahead, knowing that there is strength in numbers and immeasurable positive impact that radiates through each small act of love and creativity.","title":"Life Support"},"title":"loneliness hits different now","trackNumber":4,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0x73db03795986c1c0c5fbc6841392ba4f79a88923f056fdc7ab59c4a07f41be61462e550bb7fa7fdc6716eefa2620e0945a40e4bc7eb0fd0360aa1a2cd76b49141c","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"},"name":"loneliness hits different now","description":"“loneliness hits different now\" is the fourth track from my breakthrough album \"Life Support,\" as well as the second music NFT minted from the Dot releases. \r\n\r\nIncluded in the first auction is a signed copy of the limited edition vinyl (only 500 records made), as well as a sold-out limited edition copy of “In Good Hands Vol. 1,” which is a 2021 compilation curated by Ta-Ku and includes “loneliness hits different now.

A few days before the pandemic started in the US, I was running a producer challenge with hundreds of artists from around the world to create 5 new songs in five days, and to see what was possible when we set aside our excuses and doubts for a week and just focused on creating. As the world began to shut down and familiar structures fell apart, I decided to keep this pattern going and create one new idea per day for as many days as I could sustain. This practice was my unshakeable rock, and my online music community was (and still is) my lifeline throughout the pandemic. After producing 75 new beats in 50 days, I chose 16 of my favorites to polish up and ultimately become this album. \r\n\r\nThe past few years have exposed so many gaps and wounds on socioeconomic and environmental levels that have been widening and festering for centuries. While making music in reaction to the magnitude of problems and suffering that our world faces seems trivial in many ways, I have faith in the forces of art and sound to create lasting structural changes and profoundly influence our societies. Though small in scale, personally communicating through this medium seemed like one of the best uses of my time during a period where so much other activity has been restricted. \r\n\r\nIt is my greatest hope that this music can inspire others to show up for what they believe in every single day of their lives, come rain or shine. Our planet is in desperate need of allies and warriors to look after its healing and the wellbeing of its inhabitants, as we are all in a collective need of \"life support\" throughout all structures of our existence. I hope that each of us can bring our unique spectrum of gifts to the table in the seasons ahead, knowing that there is strength in numbers and immeasurable positive impact that radiates through each small act of love and creativity.","title":"Life Support"},"title":"phase runner","trackNumber":7,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0xd0a67996343e5299c48fea227bccf8ecb39eabf4167f8b6ea17743e0bc3bc8486ab1fcf01da51eef3b68fbb29f9c916f23e78429ca2f8f889d6b7228afd7658e1b","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"},"name":"phase runner","description":"“phase runner\" is the seventh track from my breakthrough album \"Life Support,\" and the third NFT minted of this series.\r\n\r\nIncluded in the first auction is a signed copy of the limited edition vinyl (only 500 records made), as well as a 1-hour gaming session on Apex Legends with Dot (played remotely, can swap for a zoom hangout if not a gamer). \r\n\r\nNFT owners from the Life Support series will also gain access to exclusive listening parties and events (both online and IRL) for new releases coming later this year.

Particularly when you write about things that crack your ego.\r\n\r\nIn Nov-Dec 2021 I had enrolled in a writers workshop just to keep the pen sharp.

So a lot of them turned into nothing some turned into releases but like a year after that I was living in a tiny apartment in silverlake and the a/c was leaking taking a toll on both the hardwood floors and our security deposit. So billy came over and it was a hot summer day with no a/c and we made a bunch of stuff but at the end I played him this demo and he was like “ that’s perfect, I have an idea.” I gave him the files and he came back like a week later with what is now ‘different world.’ I love that song so much and I always felt like sharing the original demo would be a powerful way to add some more context. I am excited about this as an opportunity to share a little more of what inspired the song and the story behind it and giving someone the opportunity to own a little piece of the creative process."},"address":"0xabefbc9fd2f806065b4f3c237d4b59d9a97bcac7","tokenId":"8130"},"manifestations":[{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://neume.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeidazbzv77yemgklaehdn6rugdkyakr3cqaknhebteabbeepnmansy"},{"version":"0.1.0"}]}

A few days before the pandemic started in the US, I was running a producer challenge with hundreds of artists from around the world to create 5 new songs in five days, and to see what was possible when we set aside our excuses and doubts for a week and just focused on creating. As the world began to shut down and familiar structures fell apart, I decided to keep this pattern going and create one new idea per day for as many days as I could sustain. This practice was my unshakeable rock, and my online music community was (and still is) my lifeline throughout the pandemic. After producing 75 new beats in 50 days, I chose 16 of my favorites to polish up and ultimately become this album. \r\n\r\nThe past few years have exposed so many gaps and wounds on socioeconomic and environmental levels that have been widening and festering for centuries. While making music in reaction to the magnitude of problems and suffering that our world faces seems trivial in many ways, I have faith in the forces of art and sound to create lasting structural changes and profoundly influence our societies. Though small in scale, personally communicating through this medium seemed like one of the best uses of my time during a period where so much other activity has been restricted. \r\n\r\nIt is my greatest hope that this music can inspire others to show up for what they believe in every single day of their lives, come rain or shine. Our planet is in desperate need of allies and warriors to look after its healing and the wellbeing of its inhabitants, as we are all in a collective need of \"life support\" throughout all structures of our existence. I hope that each of us can bring our unique spectrum of gifts to the table in the seasons ahead, knowing that there is strength in numbers and immeasurable positive impact that radiates through each small act of love and creativity.","title":"Life Support"},"title":"keep on","trackNumber":1,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0x232ab25ce33977bee7c02dd3c7a4eda76e0eefacc1d091be1a888f01e8749c7b23c36f0af4a0822cf298b19aeacccb1f7dd11aec54082f2f30869ff4b96c336b1b","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"},"name":"keep on","description":"“keep on\" is the opening track from my breakthrough album \"Life Support,\" and the fifth NFT minted of this series.\r\n\r\nIncluded in the primary auction is a signed copy of the limited edition vinyl (only 500 records made). \r\n\r\nNFT owners from the Life Support series will also gain access to exclusive listening parties and events (both online and IRL) for new releases coming later this year.

There are out of tune, wonky vocals, cat meows in the background, keyboard clicks, and some lyric-less vocal takes, but I think the process is just as interesting as the finished product.\r\n\tEach song comes with a unique cover art created by me based on the original album cover art mock up I made. \r\nThis is the start of a new chapter and I am thankful to have you with me.","title":"Simple, Sweet, and Smiling (The Demos)"},"title":"Simple, Sweet, and Smiling (TenTen Demo Version)","trackNumber":4,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0x04201473eb7672a32b6c25608b6f34953d03809a175e3ad9a90ce97b38aed96451f52f2c7a6d5485acf253687cd3fa3180069647d2ad3439437b2de47e3671531b","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"},"name":"Simple, Sweet, and Smiling (TenTen Demo Version)","description":"This song was called TenTen until the final hour because John Carroll Kirby and I started the idea on October 10th (very creative title).

I minted a song called “Forever”, which came out of sessions for my second album. Since then, I’ve been immensely excited about how much Web3 can change the music industry. \r\n\tI wanted my genesis NFT project to be something that exists exclusively in Web3 because I believe that power in music lies in ownership and community, both of which are not inherent to the artist and their fans in old music models. \r\n\tThis demo album is not about polished, finished songs, but about the process in making them. There are out of tune, wonky vocals, cat meows in the background, keyboard clicks, and some lyric-less vocal takes, but I think the process is just as interesting as the finished product.\r\n\tEach song comes with a unique cover art created by me based on the original album cover art mock up I made. \r\nThis is the start of a new chapter and I am thankful to have you with me.","title":"Simple, Sweet, and Smiling (The Demos)"},"title":"Seasons Bloom (Demo Version)","trackNumber":2,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0x4e7a7a5598a017d20b002767fad9ef4cb182c8683225bb440967bbe6ead119163109a8c1d49b8f4a76f179a1d6afbe0c26c5a277bcfa5633838b78df94c4260c1b","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"},"name":"Seasons Bloom (Demo Version)","description":"Seasons Bloom started out as a real mess of a logic session after I dissected it.

As an introvert, in a very loud world, I know this all too well. \"Art of the Loner\" sonically and lyrically explores this concept in a straightforward, honest way. While this song may seem very chill and calm, it was very emotionally stirring for me wile writing it. It's a quiet storm, and I hope there are some out there who may identify with it. Sonically it was an exploration in guitar tones, textured reverbs & denser vocal arrangements. I took a lot of time on my vocal arrangements. There are over a dozen or two vocal stacks.

It was one of the most genre-ambigious tracks I'd released at the time as I was transitioning into more alternative sounds.\r\n\r\nWhy airdrop free NFT's to bidders?\r\n\r\nWhenever a collector bids on an nft, that's a huge commitment. They are signifying that they I believe in your art, you and your values in web3. If someone shows that level of commitment it only makes sense to airdrop them something for their participation as a token of gratitude, particularly in these early stages of web3. As a collector, it's also a way of showing support of artists they've bid on their wallet and saying, \"I was here for this event and participated!\". Not too different from collect a sticker or merch item from a concert or album drop. I hope this becomes a standard practice with Music NFT's.

It was one of the most genre-ambigious tracks I'd released at the time as I was transitioning into more alternative sounds.\r\n\r\nWhy airdrop free NFT's to bidders?\r\n\r\nWhenever a collector bids on an nft, that's a huge commitment. They are signifying that they I believe in your art, you and your values in web3. If someone shows that level of commitment it only makes sense to airdrop them something for their participation as a token of gratitude, particularly in these early stages of web3. As a collector, it's also a way of showing support of artists they've bid on their wallet and saying, \"I was here for this event and participated!\". Not too different from collect a sticker or merch item from a concert or album drop. I hope this becomes a standard practice with Music NFT's. It can be a great way to build relationships and build community.\r\n\r\nbig thank you to @cxy & @clt for our convos that have brought this airdropping idea to life. \r\n\r\nWritten, produced & performed by McClenney\r\nmixed by: Jeff Jackson & McClenney\r\nmastered by: Ari Raskin\r\nart by: Kuba & McClenney\r\n\r\nWhat holder of the NFT gets:\r\n-let's have a call and meet!\r\n-airdropped McClenney visual NFT"},"address":"0xabefbc9fd2f806065b4f3c237d4b59d9a97bcac7","tokenId":"8417"},"manifestations":[{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://neume.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmVc62cXguzHac6RbySvTUVt1DcckwnxjYNjsLZNwpqHUr"},{"version":"0.1.0"}]}

It's a direct response to the 2020 lockdown. Its genesis came from both an emotional & practical place. My fiance and I for the first time in a while had an opportunity to spend even more time together 7 days a week as the world shut down. It gave us time we needed to bloom into the next phase of our relationship together. \"just stay\" is very literally inspired by that notion of us \"staying in\" but also the sentiment of passion & romance in the purest/rawest form. \r\n\r\nFrom a practical POV: As an indie artist, the world was shutting down, concert dates I had planned for the fall of 2020 were now in question and studio work was inevitably slowing down. I did probably what any artist would think to do: write my way out of any situation. Just stay was born from the emotion I was feeling and the necessity to hopefully soundtrack feelings of the pandemic with a song that could secure stability in my career at that time. Fortunately the song went on to become successful on streaming platforms, and was essentially the quickest I've ever written and released a song. I wrote, recorded, produced, mixed and distributed the song within about a week or two. \r\n\r\nJust stay also marked my return to mixing my own music, and was an affirming experience exploring that space again as an artist from start to finish. It was also a turning point for me as a mix engineer. I mixed my first album, Portrait in Two (2017) and had largely been doing rough mixes on my work until 2020. I've always mixed, but just stay brought me back on the forefront of the final presentation of my music in a creative way that I had missed.

I put a lot of unnecessary pressure on myself to live up the the high expectations that many have for me, and I felt the need to talk about that in a public setting. In the song I fantasize about what my life would be like had I chosen to go into a more traditional line of work. I highlight that this isn't a pop song and it's more so \"confessions of my lifestyle,\" because things haven't always been pretty for me like the guitar arrangements you hear throughout this piece.

I put a lot of unnecessary pressure on myself to live up the the high expectations that many have for me, and I felt the need to talk about that in a public setting. In the song I fantasize about what my life would be like had I chosen to go into a more traditional line of work. I highlight that this isn't a pop song and it's more so \"confessions of my lifestyle,\" because things haven't always been pretty for me like the guitar arrangements you hear throughout this piece.

In the years leading up to this healing, I felt purposeless, directionless,  and ashamed of myself for feeling like I was wasting my life. I was in hiding. \r\n\r\nThis song is an introspective conversation with my self as I reflect on the meaning of life. I ask some very important question and also give myself encouragement to keep going. This is the beginning of my deep soul transformation.\r\n\r\nThis song means so much to me & I hope that you connect with it on an emotional level & look within yourself to get to know the universe within you. It's never too late.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nLyrics\r\n\r\nDid you live a full life?\r\nOr did you just fuck around?\r\nDid you spread your wings and take that chance?\r\nOr you stuck on the ground?\r\nDid you fall in love?\r\nDid your heart make any sounds?\r\nWell I opened up my heart, took a look inside and this is what I found.\r\n\r\nLife ain't just some ones and zeros.\r\nLook into that mirror baby you will find your hero.\r\nDid you feel the breeze?\r\nKissing on your skin?\r\nOr was you just too busy focusing on your losses and wins?\r\nDid you feel?

(No)\r\nBut I tried.\r\nNeed a little bit of love.\r\nIt done been a lot of time baby I was just crying. (Yeah)\r\nBut today I am smiling.\r\nJust find a reason to smile.\r\nYou can find a reason to smile.\r\nEven if it's only one one one one one one.\r\n\r\nAy\r\nBaby is you living?\r\nOr are you just alive?\r\nTell me are you present in your body or just drifting through the skies?\r\nI ain't judging either way.\r\nI been through that deep depression.\r\nDid the shadow work and then I ran with the progression.\r\nLook I made it.\r\nFollowing my dreams.\r\nMy destiny, yeah it was fated.\r\nTried to run from it but I never could escape it.\r\nWhat's for me will always find it's way if I'm receptive.\r\nConquering my fears & now receiving all the blessings.\r\nBlack spiritual Goddess, but\r\nDon't get it fucked up, I'm a lyrical artist (Yuh)\r\nI sowed the seeds so now I'm reaping the harvest (Yuh)\r\nMe and my team yeah we be going the hardest (Yuh)\r\n\r\nYoung Living Legends finna change the world.

Between Fall 2012 through Winter of 2013, I locked myself up in my bedroom everyday and toiled over recording and mixing songs that would eventually form this new album, “Desire.”\r\n\r\nI really wanted “Desire” to have an eclectic sound to reflect the different sounds I’ve been listening to while recording the album. In particular, I found Bibio’s 2011 album, “Mind Bokeh” an inspiration in terms of eclecticism and wanted to achieve that same level of variety. I also found myself taking inspiration from a lot of my peers on soundcloud who make beats, post-dubstep, chillwave and techno tracks. I knew I wanted my sound to be very “electronic” but I also made it a point to sound warm, organic and imperfect.\r\n\r\nProduction-wise, I’d like to believe that this is my best sounding album yet. It has been a great learning process for me making this album. I found myself learning and re-learning new things in recording, mixing and mastering. I had always admired high production sounds but I also wanted the intimacy of a bedroom-produced album.\r\n\r\nTo preserve the lofi and gritty feel, most of the songs here were recorded in one-go. I also utilized home made percussions and field recordings. Sample sources include old tapes, youtube tutorials and j-pop. All of which were chopped and manipulated then rearranged to be come the backbone on most of these tracks.\r\n\r\nCollaboration was also something I heavily pursued in this album: both musically and visually. I collaborated with Davao City’s (Philippines), Skymarines on “Candy Flavored Lips.” The look and feel of the album, which is a nod to the japanese aesthetic, was courtesy of the talented visual artist Krystal Perez and features Shanghai-based photographer and artist, Mang.\r\n\r\nI did not have any working theme throughout the album but ended up making songs that I feel are somewhat connected to each other. “Desire” is a deeply emotional and personal album for me and I sincerely hope that you find something in here that you connect to. I invite you to listen to it and if you like it, you would pass it along to your friends and loved ones.","title":"Desire"},"title":"Getting to Know You","trackNumber":1,"version":"catalog-20210202","visualizer":null},"origin":{"algorithm":"secp256k1","encoding":"rlp","signature":"0x6311dc83848f882d8069375481f438874451a1a8ff4334f92cf11392f99b816670b38a508126ac54df39cb225d5c357afd24181dbf0b5479597da9cfb547ac2a1c","publicKey":"0xc236541380fc0C2C05c2F2c6c52a21ED57c37952"},"name":"Getting to Know You","description":"Originally released on April 2013 under my previous moniker \"spazzkid\".

Ultra limited Vinyl runs of 10-100 copies, limited edition cassettes, even a hand made delay pedal. As a collector of vinyl, art, & all things vintage, I have a deep appreciation for collecting & releasing things that will go on to be collectors items, hold value & bring joy to those who are lucky enough to hold them. So it only felt natural for me to explore this format as another avenue to present to discerning collectors. \r\nSo here it is.. presented with a unique variation of the original album artwork. \"Ultra Marine\" is taken from the critically acclaimed \"Path of an Empath\"  Ep this song embodies a place where elements of environmental ambient, new-age and melodic electronics gently reveal themselves through analog synthesizers, tape loops and field recordings.

The project consists of very raw ideas and experimentations of melodies and sounds. Some records are 1 minute long, and one record is about 7 minutes long. The music came from a time when I began giving music all that I had. Along the way, I did a lot that I learning about myself; about balance, about mental and physical health, about perseverance, attitude, abundance, and so much more. Those lessons that I've learned in 2021 continue to shape me today and will continue to do so, for the better.

One day in 2018, I was outside of the hospital sitting on a bench during my lunch break, and my co-workers came over and asked what I was doing.

When I got home from the contract, I put more time into the track, adding more swing to hi-hats, some bass, and a few minor mixdown changes.

I would meditate, sing, think, write, connect with nature, and other forms of shadow work.\r\n\r\nThe HeartCycles logo, which can be seen three times in the cover art represents transformation of the heart. Life & love can bring us difficult times, but that energy can always be transmuted to spring forth a new, more uplifting vibration if we look within. When we connect with our hearts in deeper ways, a new kind of magic is unlocked within us.\r\n\r\nProduced, Recorded, Performed, Mixed, Mastered, & Cover Art all done by Carissa Visionary!\r\n\r\nThe winner of this NFT will receive:\r\n- River My Tears .wav file\r\n- River My Tears Cover Art\r\n- Access to a secret discord channel where I share behind the scenes content relating to my creative process\r\n- Acknowledgement in my first music video release.\r\n\r\n---\r\nLyrics\r\n\r\nSaid no more waiting by the phone for ya\r\nI love myself so I can't put up with that old mess\r\nI'm so blessed\r\nLately I been cleansing by the river, river\r\nWaiting for my soul to be delivered, delivered\r\nTrynna hear myself a little clearer, clearer\r\nVoices fading and I wish that i was nearer\r\nNearer to me\r\nTo me\r\nTo meeeeeee\r\n\r\nHow did I get so far awayyyy?\r\nHow did i get so far awayyyyyyyyy\r\nFrom home?\r\nFrom home?\r\nFrom hoooooome?\r\n\r\nSo now I'm offering\r\nTo the river my tears\r\nNow I'm offering\r\nTo the river my tears\r\nNow I'm offering\r\nTo the river my tears\r\nMy tears\r\nMy tears\r\nMy tears\r\nPlease heal me\r\n\r\nOffering\r\nTo the river my tears\r\nNow im offering\r\nTo the river my tears\r\nNow i'm offering\r\nTo the river my tears\r\nMy tears\r\nMy tears\r\nMy tears\r\nPlease save me.\r\n\r\nOoooooohhh ooh oh ho ooh ohh ooh ohhh\r\nOoooooohhh ooh oh ho ooh ohh ooh ohhh\r\nOoooooohhh ooh oh ho ooh ohh ooh ohhh\r\nOoooooohhh ooh oh ho ooh ohh ooh ohhh\r\n\r\nAsé Oshun\r\nLife is so beautiful\r\nPlay with me wrong it's still off with your head\r\nI got goons\r\nA team full of spirit guides\r\nAnd i got crystals and i charge em up with the moon\r\nAura majestic\r\nI glow like the sun\r\nIma flower child\r\nWatch how i bloom\r\nThey know im special\r\nThe way i could light up the light up the light up the room\r\nYuh\r\nKnew i was destined for greatness way back in the back in the back in the womb yuh\r\nMaking the most of this life until im in the im in the im in the tomb\r\nYuh\r\nI know im the one\r\nCuz im eating when there is no there is no there is no spoon yuh\r\nBeen through the struggle\r\nSo i gotta get back in tune\r\n\r\nNow i'm offering\r\nTo the river my tears\r\nNow im offering\r\nTo the river my tears\r\nNow i'm offering\r\nTo the river my tears\r\nMy tears\r\nMy tears\r\nMy tears\r\nPlease heal me.\r\n\r\nOffering\r\nTo the river my tears\r\nNow im offering\r\nTo the river my tears\r\nNow i'm offering\r\nTo the river my tears\r\nMy tears\r\nMy tears\r\nMy tears\r\nPlease save me.\r\n\r\nYeaaahhhh ee yeahh ee yeahh hehh ee yeah ho (Hoo ooh ooh ooh ooh)\r\nYeaaahhhh ee yeahh ee yeahh hehh ee yeah ho (Hoo ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)\r\nYeaaahhhh ee yeahh ee yeahh hehh ee yeah ho (Hoo ooh ooh ooh ooh)\r\nYeaaahhhh ee yeahh ee yeahh hehh ee yeah ho (Hoo ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)"},"address":"0xabefbc9fd2f806065b4f3c237d4b59d9a97bcac7","tokenId":"9620"},"manifestations":[{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://neume.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/Qme5vQrQ7QpXjywML4dZhhCb2y2bu4knTsZMKyEsV8XhH1"},{"version":"0.1.0"}]}

The music burns with an unabridged intensity, completely different from his last body of work, Buried At Sea. The unhinged and experimental nature of the label’s ethos shines brightly across the new work, defined through a duality of futuristic progressions in electronic music and past influences forged from a multitude of genres. Many traditional mathematical concepts and references are scattered throughout the song titles and factored into the modeling efforts of the compositions themselves, bridging together the surreal and the measurable; the infinitely unattainable with the tangible. Lemniscate will be pressed in a limited edition run of 100 cassette tapes and will be available on streaming services worldwide. \n\nFeatures and collaborations comprise the bulk of the recordings on Lemniscate, bridging together many minds from the Dome of Doom family: AHEE, Holly, CLYDE, Gangus, and SnakeFoot. Wylie Cable adds further insight on why he selected the musicians found on the new LP, “When I chose people to collaborate with I always want it to be someone who's artistic decisions I already naturally enjoy, that way I don't have to spend time trying to steer the project one direction or another, and you get to let people do what they are most talented at without restraint. All the projects with collaborators on the album went through many stages of change, in most cases starting as an in-person session that we then sent back and forth over and over, kind of like a process of refining and filtering a precious substance.” Every artist is integral to the shape of the whole, blending their personalities and styles with a cohesion that sticks to the surface of the LP’s flow.  \n\nConceptually, Wylie Cable found inspiration for the design of Lemniscate in his obsession with the concept of infinity and its mathematical entanglement with the spiritual concepts of the afterlife and the infinite nature of reincarnation and past selves.  \n\n“In algebraic geometry, a lemniscate is any of several figure-eight or ∞-shaped curves. The word comes from the Latin \"lēmniscātus\" meaning \"decorated with ribbons\", from the Greek λημνίσκος meaning \"ribbons\",  or which alternatively may refer to the wool from which the ribbons were made” - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemniscate \n\nUnlike all the previous works in his catalog, Wylie Cable visualized the concept for Leminscate in one lightning-bolt like experience during a late-night work session. Quickly documenting his vision on a set of note cards as each part of the record revealed itself, Wylie Cable describes the experience in more detail, “I was sitting in my house late at night near the end of last year, probably around 3 am just writing and sketching in my notebooks and brainstorming ideas, then suddenly I was hit with this huge flash of inspiration.  The title for the album, the names of the tracks, the collaborators I wanted to be involved, all sort of suddenly fell in my lap in a moment. I frantically wrote it all down on some note cards I had laying around and the process for making the album started.  This is interesting to me because usually, my process involves making lots of music and then finding what from a collection feels like an album. This was almost the opposite process, where I got the full concept for a record all at once and had to build the parts one by one to fill in the conceptual piece in my mind.  Many song names on the album make references to \"lemniscate\" and the concept of infinity. I think this album is also a reflection on our inevitable death and the cyclical nature of life.” \n \n\nWylie Cable added a number of unique instrumentation across Lemniscate that gives its tonality a bold and fierce magnetism, including this year’s newly released analog synthesizer module from Moog, Sirin, as well as Oberheim’s Viscount Joint Venture, Arturia’s Keystep, the renowned mid-70s vintage synth Octave Kitten, and his late father's Fender Jazz Bass. A fusion of electronic influences spanning the last three decades emerges when listening to the album front to back, speaking the language of Dome of Doom’s creative force. Revered hip-hop artist Jonwayne mixed a large portion of the record, with labelmate Gangus taking on mastering duties. \n\nLemniscate begins with a tremendous jolt of energy, the first song “Aleph (feat. AHEE)” combines ‘90s era Drum & Bass dance floor energy with the forward-leaning beat-centric ethos of LA’s underground music scene. A close friend and labelmate, AHEE is the first collaborator on the album and created all the bass sounds in the track with the Prophet X. Most of the piece was co-written in the studio by both artists, with Wylie lacing the entire piece with a montage of synth melodies and AHEE programming drum rhythms. The song charges through quick rhythm changes and arrives at a haunting quarter-time breakdown, composed later on in the process by Wylie, that explodes with a darkened state of surrealism.  \n\nPortugal’s Holly contributes on the exotic, smoldering, and dynamic pace of “Decorated With Ribbons.” Holly’s raw and intense mixture of sidewinding rhythms and sample chops crystallizes through every measure, balanced by the more meditative and slow-moving sections composed by Wylie that are draped with sitar and vocal contortions. Wylie also recorded live flute performances by MJ Noble at his home studio, layering and composing with the raw recordings the same way someone would rip samples from their favorite jazz record to make new melodies with. These added live recordings help create one of the most peaceful and beautiful sections across the entire album. Wylie Cable and Gangus’ “Oculus Non Vidit” is one of the album’s most powerful pieces, incorporating Middle Eastern scales, syncopated drum patterns influenced by the likes of Aphex Twin and Squarepusher, and quickly shifting sections that feel like a heightened state of controlled chaos. It’s one of the most palatable and universal songs of LP, suited for large speaker systems deep in nature. \n\n\"Mobius Strip,\" a collaboration with United Kingdom’s CLYDE, is a hypnotic and album defining tune that takes the listener through the evolution of their respective sounds and finds a middle ground that feels like new sonic material for both artists. The track revolves around a cyclical yet unmeasurable vocal chant, with deep sub-bass rhythms changing and shifting to create a wide array of feelings and styles in one song. “Wool” features the ever-expanding talents of Snakefoot, calculated and precise in measure cycles, sample variation, and overall structure.  The album’s conclusion is meditatively somber, rich in a drowned array of guitar and analog driven electronics devoid of drums. The guitar samples were recorded by venerable Los Angeles-based musician Kenny Segal and played by Ryan Crosby, a frequent collaborator on many of Segal's productions and songs. Wylie Cable chopped, flipped, reversed, stretched, and further mutilated the recordings into a dream-like sequence meant to evoke the late writer Nabokov sitting in his hotel in Montreux, examining his butterfly collection and knowing that this is his life's final chapter. \n\nLemniscate is an album that finds Wylie Cable turning internal voyages and collaborative efforts into a vortex of sound. A footprint in the search for what else life has to offer after we transition and the memories that we leave behind when charting intersecting paths.  \n\nPurchase/stream Lemniscate here:  https://domeofdoom.lnk.to/Lemniscate\n \nTracklisting: \n\n1.

The record releases September 25th on Cable's imprint Dome of Doom and is the 8th full-length in his catalog. The compositional formats across the 40 minute album are dense and dynamic, bursting with heavy rhythms, crystalized harmonies, soothing breakdowns, and technical finesse. IDM, downtempo, lofi house, 808 filled trap, LA-centric beats, musique concrète, drum ‘n bass, jungle, modern classical; it’s an encyclopedia of 21st century sound that interlaces Cable’s musical voice with distinction and purpose. In this context, the album acts as one of the artists’ most realized works in musical range. Features across Shimmer, Then Disappear include a number of artists connected to the Dome of Doom family: Holly, Dabow, GOD.DAMN.CHAN, Goodnight Cody, and Call Me. Cable mixed the entire LP, with mastering from Daddy Kev at Cosmic Zoo Studios. Album artwork was completed by Dewey Saunders, an artist internationally known for album cover work with Anderson Paak, Future, Nxworries, Felly, Griz, and more. \n\nThe collaborative recording process and abundance of gear on Shimmer, Then Disappear makes this an album of constant surprises and new revelations on repeated listens. Most sessions were completed at Cable’s home studio in the hills of LA and the gear set-up included a laptop, Ableton, Kitten Octave, Oberheim/Viscount OB-3 Squared, Roland TR-8, Roland JP-08, Critter & Guitari Pocket Piano GR, Arturia Keystep, Moog Sirin, AKG C214, and the AKG C 414 B-ULS. The Roland TR-8 and the Roland JP-08 were both given to Cable on loan by Daedelus right before he set off to Boston for his new position at Berklee on the EDI faculty. Daedelus' only request was that Cable keep making music. Argentina’s Dabow and Portugal’s Holly were both in Los Angeles during the same week last year, creating at Cable’s studio for a day straight and coming up with one of the record’s hardest hitting tracks. Maine’s GOD.DAMN.CHAN also created his two features at Cable’s studio during a trip to the west coast last year, knocking out their collaborations with speed and ferocity. They dive in and out of musical ideas first poured from pioneering and next generation artists across Warp and Ninja Tune. Los Angeles multi-instrumentalist Goodnight Cody was the only musician to record his part outside of Cable’s studio, submitting a solo recording of slide guitar for future processing and reconfiguring. Like many of his records over the years, Cable also adds vox, supplanting lyrics of self-examination and personal perseverance that are some of his most direct and intentional lyrics ever. All collaborations occurred before the COVID-19 pandemic, cementing the structure of the LP well before its eventual release in 2020.\n\nAfter the mental fog created from the world's collective state of social unrest started to slowly subside and the changing landscape within the touring/music industry was adapted to, Cable was able to initiate the second process of the album and flesh out the rest of the music. In March, during the initial shutdowns in Los Angeles, Cable locked himself in his home studio for a period of weeks and began making a new song every day. This would initiate first thing in the morning when he woke up. It happened slowly but it became an important process in finishing the record and creating most of the new solo material. In this process chain of the recording sessions and what was absorbed during those times, the album is a bridge from the world we knew into the world we all live in now. A perfect reflection of the transitional energy that was brought onto the world collectively over the last nine months. Closing the album in a similar fashion to past records with a beatless and sobering piece, the Mac Miller tribute “Mac Flip” was sourced from a sample Cable found online from a Canadian producer by the name Two Swings. It ties in the final scope of the record with a reflection on artistic influence and the value we hold on those who are still here and those who leave us. Labelmate thook, who released his Noise LP on DoD last year, was the one who first showed Cable the track. “I discovered this artist Two Swings from Canada through thook, who released his Noise LP on the label last year. Two Swings had made a song called \"Tribute to Malcolm\" that was released on SoundCloud, and I found it through a repost on thook's account. It's a really beautiful piece and starts with this piano and string section that I used to create my flip of the song. The original version from Two Swings then goes on to drop into a remix with some of Malcolm's vocals, etc. I just clipped the initial few second loop and used it as material to compose new melodies with. I also reached out to Two Swings to get their blessings to use the sample, since it sounded to me like the intro was an original recording. They were down so it ended up on the record.”\n\nConceptually, Shimmer, Then Disappear is presented with an overall flow that connects all titles and thematic song styles as one dynamic story. The creator of this work takes up the lead character role, soul searching as realities start to cave in and exit ramps ensue. Cable elaborates further on the conceptual theme of the album, “The first song is called \"How to Disappear\", the second song is called \"Travel Light'', then the next \"End All Contracts.''  To me, the tracklist reads like a deranged to-do list of this character that is attempting to erase themselves and start a new life. Read chronologically, the track list tells the story of someone attempting to disappear, but coming up against all the pitfalls that, as humans, we all have. \"Contacting People from your Past\", \"The Lure of Personal Success\" and \"Short Game vs Long Game\" all speak to our desires to be connected to others. It is no way natural for us as a species to be isolated or cut off from our family groups, but in our modern world this has increasingly become the case whether we like it or not. I feel like I tell that story most directly on \"Change Your Name\" with the lyrics \"What you see, is what you get, and what if you could change your name? Would you run from your regrets, or would you keep it all the same?\" I guess for me music is always just a time capsule of my life at the time I was making it.” Pacing, peaks, valleys, bursts, the calm; every track follows from one another energetically and offers a personal unpacking of one’s soul. A vulnerability in transmitted reflections that pushes postering and ego to the side.\n\nThe album title for Shimmer, Then Disappear has roots dug into Wylie Cable’s CalArts days in the early 2000s and his initial discovery of the works of Muslimgauze during this time. Wylie pulled the LP's title from a Muslimgauze song of the same name that appears on the 1997 LP Jaal Ab Dullah (Soleilmoon Recordings). “I'm sure the reference will be lost on 99% of people though as Muslimgauze has become a more obscure name in the electronic music collectors world. I personally have been obsessed with his music since college though. My old friend David Cohen introduced me to Muzlimgauze's music in his CalArts sublevel studio in the film department. We used to hang out endlessly and listen to the dudes music trying to figure out how he made all this shit with dub tape loops in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s. I really think you hear a lot of Muslimgauze influence in all of underground bass music, even if it's not a commonly regarded opinion. The guy was making insane distorted 808 breakbeat loops, recording all his own percussion and samples and doing the takes live on a board playing it like an instrument, ala King Tubby and other dub pioneers that advanced music by approaching studio equipment with new ideas that became commonplace later. As far as what the title means to me personally, I feel it's yet another way to look at impermanence, here today, gone tomorrow sort of a thing. My hope is that with my time on the planet I can create some things that are beautiful that remind others that there is wonder and grace and love in human nature... then disappear.”\n\nWhile running Dome of Doom over the last nine years, unfiltered culture has been injected into the underground music community with every release, flipping a staggering 18,000+ cassette tapes since the label's inception. Releasing music on his own label has afforded Cable the creative flexibility to mold his releases in an uncompromised vision and to connect dots that are personalized and true to his goals as a creative artist looking to bring worthwhile change to this world. Shimmer, The Disappear is the ethos of this mission at its core, presenting one-of-a-kind fusions that find their origins as a synthesis of Cable’s time as a classically trained upright bassist and his lifelong experiences within the hip-hop, punk, hardcore, and electronic music communities.\n\n\nTracklisting\n\n1.

Matched with similarly gripping abstract collage work from Dewey Saunders, whose visuals have previously accompanied work by Anderson .Paak, Future, and Griz, Cable’s \"Shimmer, Then Disappear\" LP looks to be the producer’s reflective output in response to the monumental shifts the world has experienced, and ultimately, where we may be headed from here.\" - Dancing Astronaut"},"address":"0xabefbc9fd2f806065b4f3c237d4b59d9a97bcac7","tokenId":"9703"},"manifestations":[{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://neume.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeifme477udwilf36obvbi4jmwvhc3x6rkgu2tun2sfsiqq2azk63lm"},{"version":"0.1.0"}]}

The new record drops worldwide on vinyl and digital platforms August 27th and follows her debut LP Drenched, initially released in March of 2020. Diligently working on her follow-up since last year as the pandemic surged and life continued to transform, QRTR has unloaded a treasure trove of hypnotic grooves that vortex around the many intricacies of her experimental approach and leave testament to her growth as an artist. All tracks were mixed by QRTR and mastered by Ryan Schwabe (Oneohtrix Point Never, Tierra Whack, Shamir, RJD2).\r\n\r\nRooted in the transfixing worlds of house, infina ad nausea finds unique deviations, including drum ‘n bass, ambient, classical, and IDM. The record was produced at various home studio locations around Brooklyn, with some of the material dating back to 2017. Field recordings were captured at Notre Dame, Paris in 2018, as well as Catskills, New York in 2020. Every track is filled to the brim with synths, percussion, drums, samples and original vocal parts from QRTR that underscore her range as a producer and arranger. Features include QRTR’s cat companion, the infamous ambientkitty, LA-based electronic producer and vocalist artemis orion, and New York artists Braille, Daniel de Lara, and CSLTY.\r\n\r\nMuch like QRTR’s maiden voyage on Dome of Doom, infina ad nausea derives meaning through concept form and the way artistic and personal life collide in the most challenging ways. From the titles and their sonic derivatives, down to the order of the tracks across the LP and how they transition from one song to another, every aspect of the LP is a piece of the puzzle that endlessly spirals over one another. QRTR adds further context, “infina ad nausea is a play on latin terms “ad infinitum” and “ad nauseum.” I was trying to create a phrase to describe growing sick of a false feeling of permanence, as though you're living in a never ending loop. I was steeping in the concept of “spiral” which is a theme I’ve been coming back to constantly in my art and life since 2011. I always felt as though I was living within a series of full circles overlapping on each other (creating the illusion of a spiral). I have a tattoo on my arm that I designed in an effort to visually express the idea. The concept of this album feels a little larger than life to me and difficult to describe and that is exactly what I was trying to encompass sonically. I arranged the track order in a way that felt like the act of spiraling internally (mentally and emotionally). It starts off bright and playful and becomes more frenzied until suddenly you’ve reached “the point” - which is ever moving and evolving and thus unreachable.”\r\n\r\ninfina ad nausea is an album full of deep exploration that builds on the level of musicality present on Drenched and raises the bar even higher. Utilizing a palette of different synth tones, rhythm structures, and genre modes from track to track, little pockets become an oasis of sudden bursts, void outs, and all out scenery changes. As the panoramic landscaping of the longer sections leave the soul enthralled, little bits and pieces float everywhere in the mix, capturing endless details as the auditory lens rotates through the mixes. Nothing feels stitched or separated, flowing with a constant state of motion and seamlessness. Forming as chapters, every song has an abundance of meaning and description while tapping into its own special vibe. There are no two-tracks that are exactly alike. The album’s sole interlude, “Nossa,” is one of QRTR’s most expansive and breathtaking works in the ambient field, utilizing vocal choir harmony in a way that feels ancient and experimentally classical. The first half of “Ritual (feat. CSLTY)” is equally riveting and emotionally consuming in the name of ambient music, catapulted into the second section of the piece once the drum ‘n bass rhythm burst. It's a transformation that happens at lightspeed while remaining glued to the original essence with the ongoing overtones.\r\n\r\nOn “With You,” QRTR (NY) and artemis orion (LA) conjoin the coastal vibes of the US for one of the lushest grooves of the album, orchestrated with a sense of songwriting that shows their strengths as singular creators and collaborators. The energy of the club wavers with brilliance on album singles “Want Me 2” and “Fractals,” foreshadowing the experiences on the dance floor to come and those that paved the way prior. One of the album's defining connections appears with the bookend effect between the album opener, “The Outer Edge (feat. ambientkitty)” and its counterpart LP closer, “Lucid (feat. Braille).” Both find a way to slip between complex melody layers that bubble around one another and deep swelling experimental build-ups that pull from Pink Floyd-esque synth lines and William Basinski influenced soundscapes. Every track from infina ad nausea gives a new world to explore, adding to the chains of cyclical renewal that flows through the LP.\r\n\r\nQRTR is one of electronic music’s brightest upcoming voices and has carved out another important mark in her legacy with infina ad nausea. A work that pushes back on neat packaging and easy access points, standing as an opulently expressive and raw statement that takes into account the full range of human experience.\r\n\r\nTrack Listing\r\n\r\n1.

CSLTY","description":"“Ritual” is the ninth track on the infina ad nausea LP featuring my friend CSLTY. This track is the brief touch-base with clarity, when the frenzied thoughts reassemble into fresh ideas. CSLTY initially sent me an ambient demo for this track, which I sampled and reworked into a higher energy space.\r\n\r\ninfina ad nausea is a play on latin terms “ad infinitum” and “ad nauseum.” I was trying to create a phrase to describe growing sick of a false feeling of permanence, as though you're living in a never ending loop. \r\n\r\nAlbum title painted in VR by Logan Larkin. Album designed by NFT artist Jack Robinson. Album cover photo taken by Bren Haragan. \r\n\r\nPhysical unlockables include a signed vinyl LP and an infina ad nausea long sleeved t-shirt. \r\n\r\ninfina ad nausea written and produced in Brooklyn, NY by Meagan Rodriguez."},"address":"0xabefbc9fd2f806065b4f3c237d4b59d9a97bcac7","tokenId":"9974"},"manifestations":[{"version":"0.1.0","uri":"https://neume.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeige545uaxhmwzwlkr4jrfm3siycujxj4w7yisxxrcjym4wf5dbony"},{"version":"0.1.0"}]}
