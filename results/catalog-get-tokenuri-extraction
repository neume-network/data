In particular, I love how both artists use a combination of space, simplicity, and distortion in their instrumental storytelling. I also find beauty in sharply contrasted sections of melodic vs. atonal elements. Add in some dub vocal samples and we're in business. \r\n\r\nYou'll find the first half to be a more sparse stroll, whereas the second half has a rushed timewarp feel. \r\n\r\nThis is the sixth song on my album Last Chance At Life. Each song is part of a larger story in which three friends leave a ravaged Earth behind in search of a new planet. \r\n\r\nOn 'Requiem' one of the members of the crew, Omar, stumbles across the remains of his grandfather while exploring through a cave. Omar's grandfather had mysteriously vanished years before after claiming to have discovered a new planet. \r\n\r\nNo one in his family had ever really believed in his mission besides Omar, so the discovery of his bones was both redeeming and heart-wrenching. \r\n\r\nTo read the full story, go here: https://www.houndtrack.com/last-chance-at-life\r\n\r\nEach song on the Last Chance At Life album has its own artwork created by Leonardo Silva (@itwasleo on socials) and mastered by Lukas Turza of Snap Mastering.","duration":181.185,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x17c72771bb6b283bade0c07e0901744c37ff8c41/requiem-1650481000","image":"ipfs://bafybeic7hruy3u3qwssggdl6xhgt5szrrzncbbv7337v6pwtrqx7x5h76a","losslessAudio":"ipfs://bafybeihi7dkqgexhoksndfxu4x5yl2a36kq7i3acfyo5pn37mqxjzlgotm","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"HOUNDTRACK - Requiem","project":{"artwork":{"uri":"ipfs://bafybeic7hruy3u3qwssggdl6xhgt5szrrzncbbv7337v6pwtrqx7x5h76a","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},"title":"Last Chance At Life","description":"Earth is being ravaged by humans' destruction.

It was a time in my life where everyday was a struggle just to make ends meet. I used to drive a car that would randomly cut off on the interstate. I mean like literally cut off and I would have to pray it would crank back up while doing about 80 mph (crazy I know). But even during those trying times I never let it get the best of me. I knew I was destined for something better and that those trials and tribulations were just preparation. \r\n\r\nI'm a firm believer in the law of attraction. I used to lived a fast life filled with negativity that often made me think in the same manner as my environment. When I realized that I could change my life by changing my mindset, life changed for me.

I was at a friends BBQ trying to convince them to give Ableton Live a shot instead of using FL Studio.  They were very resistant to change and wanted no part in learning a new DAW haha.  After a few hours of repeatedly asking, I was finally able to get him to sit down and let me show him how fast my work flow was compared to FL Studio.  The pre-warping step is where every person i've taught Ableton to gets frustrated.  When you are dealing with Jazz, classical or any form of music that isn't quantized or that changes time signatures,  it extends the amount of time it takes to properly warp the sample.  Everyone has different methods for this, for me personally.  I create a new clip at each new time signature change.  It's a lot of prep work so this is where I usually lose people that are used to just manually chopping records quickly.  Especially since I take the time to always do the entire song instead of just \"the dope parts\".  The Warp and Auto-chop feature allows me to turn a sample into a instrument.  Having each note at my disposal.  I also take extra steps like tapping the tempo,  half timing the sample.  Then Re-sampling at the slower tempo.  Freezing it.  bringing the tempo back to its normal bpm, then once again resampling it so I can chop it and retain the more stretched out version.  Which is a lengthy process but one I feel is worth it for what i'm trying to achieve.  Then i'll Autochop multiple instances to different samplers.  Some at 1/4 notes,  some at 1/8 notes,  1/2 notes etc..       Sounds like it's more complicated than it is, but after repetition,  this process goes by pretty quickly.  So after I showed him all the steps,  He was beginning to get frustrated and didn't want to keep learning. At this point,  I didn't even have any drums loaded up and he was becoming super Antsy.  I didn't want him to walk away before I showed him why I took the time to do all that. So I pressed record,  and blindly laid some chops in one quick take.  No metronome, no grid.  Because I took time to do all the prep work,  I was confident any chop I chose would perfectly land on beat. People are usually hesitant to sample songs with loud drums and try to chop around them, but I usually can mask any loud drums by using ghost kicks and sidechain compression. Since I had no drums loaded up or any effects.  I knew the drums in the sample would be present in all my chops, so I used them as my compass and thus,  \"NoUse\" for was born. He hated the beat and to this day he still uses FL Studio haha. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"Traversal\" ended up seeing two separate releases, each with slight variations.  \r\n\r\nThe Original version that I released digitally on bandcamp and all streaming services in Winter of 2015 (which was the first and last album I ever uploaded to the streaming services) \r\n[ https://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/traversal ]\r\n\r\nand the cassette version released in Winter of 2016 via Grand Garden Records.  \r\n[https://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/traversal-grand-garden]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**** Whoever ends up collecting this will receive a link to my master cloud based vault \"Dutchyyy vs the Algorithms\" over 110gb's of nearly my full released and unreleased discography.  *****","duration":126.407,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x26ef03a20aaeda8aafcee4e146dc6b328195947c/nouse-1655854727","image":"ipfs://QmfMu3zDC485PCJi7e6AjSvB8NVrHsMGKVLWocnU7u4gpF","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmSkz9MVUVt7qxs68WxMREAEK3omEoyunJ6jkteGcgjVDD","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"Dutchyyy - NoUse","project":{"artwork":{"uri":"ipfs://QmfMu3zDC485PCJi7e6AjSvB8NVrHsMGKVLWocnU7u4gpF","mimeType":"image/png"},"title":"Traversal","description":"\"NoUse\" - Produced by Dutchyyy\r\n\r\n\"Traversal\" ended up seeing two separate releases, each with slight variations.  \r\n\r\nThe Original version that I released digitally on bandcamp and all streaming services in Winter of 2015 (which was the first and last album I ever uploaded to the streaming services) \r\n[ https://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/traversal ]\r\n\r\nand the cassette version released in Winter of 2016 via Grand Garden Records.  \r\n[https://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/traversal-grand-garden]"},"title":"NoUse","trackNumber":20,"version":"catalog-20220222"}}

So it was the first track created for \"Chill Gawd, Chill\"\r\n\r\nhttps://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/chill-gawd-chill\r\n\r\nBackstory: \r\n\"Chill Gawd, Chill\" was released initially February 5th 2015 Digitally on Bandcamp and as A 120minute (2 hour) Cassette, that came with Nag Champa.   It sold out immediately and was bandcamp's best selling Cassette.   Due to high demand and fomo,  I was pressured into doing a second pressing of Cassette w/ Nag Champa which dropped on my birthday, May 23rd 2016,  Once again it sold out immediately and was bandcamp's best selling cassette for 2 weeks in a row.   Obviously, my most popular / successful instrumental album as Dutchyyy (fka Dutchy) the demand to upload this to streaming was unbearable.  To this Day,  \"Chill Gawd, Chill\" remains only available on bandcamp.  In fall of 2020,  I did one final pressing of the two hour tape w/ Nag Champa.   It was the last time I will press \"this version\" of the cassette.  The problem was,  I pulled 4 songs what was supposed to be my follow up album \"The Uproot\" and placed them on \"Chill Gawd, Chill\" last minute.  Those songs were \"Evolution of a shrug\" / \"The Scramble\" / \"Lamb's Bread\" (feat. Ash Tre Jinkins & Sleepy Eyes) and removed a few songs that were created specifically for \"Chill Gawd, Chill\"   this decision derailed the release of \"The Uproot\" and it still remains officially unreleased to this day.  Instead I released \"Traversal\" next,  which is actually the follow up album to the \"The Uproot\".  (confusing huh?)  \r\n\r\nCollecting this,  you will receive a copy of rare / sold out final pressing of \"Chill Gawd, Chill\" + Nag Champa (which will ship in June with all the other orders)  It will also Unlock me minting the title track \"Chill Gawd, Chill\" which if collected, will finally unlock this from being gated to bandcamp only.   I will finally end my protest and upload \"Chill Gawd, Chill\" to all streaming services. \r\n\r\n*****Whoever ends up collecting this will receive a link to my master cloud based vault \"Dutchyyy vs the Algorithms\" over 110gb's of nearly my full released and unreleased discography.  *****\r\n\r\nThe most valuable wisdom I can offer to anyone, is \"Just Be Yourself\".

I see too many thoughts daily, So I shifted my creative energy into expression without words. beats, keys, sample manipulation, experimenting with creating new worlds from nothing, or evolving a sample into the unrecognizable just music in general, just speaking without using words.\r\n\r\nHip Hop stopped inspiring or surprising me, with minimal exceptions. The fun aspect of being an emcee or making music kind of fell out of style. where up until about 2011, it was everywhere, so accessible. such a vibe, easy to bounce that creative energy back into the world.\r\n\r\nbut I still am an emcee, passionate, over talkative, TMI, super expressive human IRL.\r\n\r\nbut losing chronologic timelines on social media (yep i'm going there again) really changed how humans communicate online. Expansive conversations don't happen by design, everything is fragmented, and anything long form is taboo, especially using your words to communicate on these apps. you see a paragraph, you think rant. Crazy right? I'm the crazy one? nah this new fragmented, A.I. manipulated timeline we all living in doesn't want nor allow for expansive dialog to happen in real time anymore. Everyone's on a soap box, trapped, reacting, and dunking basically always in offense or defense mode. hahaha I grew tired of battle rap in the early 2000's, now soccer moms, senators and the whole worlds has battle rap energy haha.\r\n\r\nYou think this discouraged me, nah. I let that lil light shine in private haha, I missed when hip-hop was fun, so i had fun with hip-hop in private, got all my venting out and recorded it every time. Freestyling and flipping samples is all do, while rebelling publicly, hoarding insane amounts of beats, and albums, i got super addicted to recording everything in real time.. The rawest and truest form of expression.... having fun, being introspective on autopilot.\r\n\r\nAbsolute freedom.\r\n\r\nbut this stuff was never intended to be heard by anyone. DailyRambles is me loading up a batch of beats on the Tascam DR-05 that i haven't listened to yet, and blindly freestyling and seeing which ones move me enough to make me wanna sit and write, and having fun with the ones that don't fit my voice or style and have fun trying to make it work.\r\n\r\nI had zero intentions to make any of these freestyles public,  but due to severe health complications, I might not always be here and even if I am able to somehow course correct by pure miracle and insane amounts of debt,  it would alter my ability to speak the same and/or articulate the way I do now. \r\n\r\nThere may never be another well thought out, written and recorded \"Dutchmassive\" album in the future. But there is 6 years worth of \"DailyRambles\" right now.\r\nI'm reluctant about even dropping this as Dutchmassive, even though polls on all \"social media\" unanimously chose it over the alias \"Reluctant Clap\"\r\n\r\nI won't always be here. I'd rather this silly introspective gibberish be out in the world, then locked away on my hard drive.\r\n\r\n********Collecting this, will Unlock a new Artist profile on Catalog Works. \"Dutchmassive\" where I will release freestyles from the Reluctant Clap / Daily Rambles series as well as songs from my official albums known as the emcee Dutchmassive.

Being on the mountain in nature, isolated and having space to walk outside without running into strangers at every step was a much needed change of pace.   I blossomed isolated surrounded by so much natural beauty untouched by man mad hands. Towards the end of my stay,  Early 2015, my friend reached out to me and asked me if I would play a show in Brooklyn.  As much as i loved playing music for people.  NY city is the polar opposite of a secluded Nature Preserve,  and after a year in isolation, the thought of taking trains and subways gave me a panic attack which I wasn't expecting.  I thought I healed and was past all that.  So I declined.  He would not take no for an answer, and I didn't like the fact that I had gained a fear of doing such a normal thing like traveling into the city,  something I've done a million times before so I caved and agreed to do the show.   I took a train to union station, and I remember  walking up those stairs and stepping out into the city and there were literal Tanks lined up, cops everywhere and more people than I had seen in years.  I felt like a time traveler out of place, spooked by loud noises and anxiously tried to find directions to get to Brooklyn.  When I finally arrived at the apartment my friend was staying at.  I told myself, I never walking out of the door haha.  My friend DJ introduced me to his friend and our host Brian, and we immediately started talking about music.  He asked what I used to create and told him Ableton Live.  He said he always wanted to learn Ableton, so without hesitation I said,  \"well class in session, I'm going to teach you right now\"  he asked if I was hungry,  I said \"I'm too anxious to eat at the moment, but we can reward ourselves with sustenance after we get a quick session in\" .  I pulled out my laptop,  let him pick a sample and showed him my process.  You know,  all the boring set up stuff that happens before you're able to properly execute ideas.  In Typical Dutch fashion,  I got tunnel vision but had anxiety, knowing I would eventually have to walk out the door and go out in public. So I channeled that energy and imagined an escape route,  bypassing all the crowds of strangers and my mind wondered to thoughts of climbing down a latter that leads to a submarine that could just go under the city instead of through it to get back to the mountain and thus, \"Sub(Marine)UnderBrooklyn\" was born.  You can hear me working through my emotions trying to find a peaceful resolve and reaching conflict in the middle, but in the end I make it peacefully to the surface.  I personally like the Cassette version of this song more (Dynamics Crushed, but a little more punchy) but I don't think most people would be able to tell the difference and this was the original export.\r\n\r\nP.S.  I was fine for the rest of the trip.  Played a dope house set,  said my goodbyes and took the train back to the nature preserve.  This remains one of my favorite tracks of the thousands I've made over the years.  Music is a form a meditation.  It's saved my life, more times than I can count, quite literally...  but we will save that backstory for another time.  \r\n\r\n\"Traversal\" ended up seeing two separate releases, each with slight variations.  \r\n\r\nThe Original version that I released digitally on bandcamp and all streaming services in Winter of 2015 (which was the first and last album I ever uploaded to the streaming services) \r\n[ https://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/traversal ]\r\n\r\nand the cassette version released in Winter of 2016 via Grand Garden Records.  \r\n[https://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/traversal-grand-garden]\r\n\r\n**** Whoever ends up collecting this will receive a link to my master cloud based vault \"Dutchyyy vs the Algorithms\" over 110gb's of nearly my full released and unreleased discography.  *****","duration":240.048,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x26ef03a20aaeda8aafcee4e146dc6b328195947c/sub-marine-underbrooklyn-1655055284","image":"ipfs://QmfMu3zDC485PCJi7e6AjSvB8NVrHsMGKVLWocnU7u4gpF","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmPFNTxVTY7hFitiKp5M4z9DFTc1Wrc2m4ic4soyoNizMV","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"Dutchyyy - Sub(Marine)UnderBrooklyn","project":{"artwork":{"uri":"ipfs://QmfMu3zDC485PCJi7e6AjSvB8NVrHsMGKVLWocnU7u4gpF","mimeType":"image/png"},"title":"Traversal","description":"Traversal (Digital Version) - Track 15 - \"Sub(Marine)UnderBrooklyn\" - Produced by Dutchyyy\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Traversal\" ended up seeing two separate releases, each with slight variations.  \r\n\r\nThe Original version that I released digitally on bandcamp and all streaming services in Winter of 2015 (which was the first and last album I ever uploaded to the streaming services) \r\n[ https://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/traversal ]\r\n\r\nand the cassette version released in Winter of 2016 via Grand Garden Records.  \r\n[https://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/traversal-grand-garden]"},"title":"Sub(Marine)UnderBrooklyn","trackNumber":15,"version":"catalog-20220222"}}

I love a challenge and I wasn't busy, so I immediately agreed to the challenge and said I would have it posted to Soundcloud later that night.  I ended up choosing the sample used in Smif & Wessun's classic single \"Buck Town\".  I quickly programed a kick & a snare, then began chopping.   A few hours later it was uploaded to the Soundcloud.  The original version was a bit slower, had a few more chop change up's and only a kick and snare.  A few days later,  I was speaking with Chester Watson about my upcoming Cassette while we were swapping songs back and forth just showing each other unreleased & new music. The next day he sent me back the version you hear now.  Slightly sped up,  added some filler drums and a bassline that melts your face along with any decent system it's played on.  I added a intro,  and decided to place it on my upcoming cassette \"Chill Gawd, Chill\" and thus \"Turning Point\" was born and the original version was deleted from Soundcloud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Chill Gawd, Chill\" was released initially February 5th 2015 Digitally on Bandcamp and as A 120minute (2 hour) Cassette, that came with Nag Champa.   It sold out immediately and was Bandcamp's best selling Cassette.   Due to high demand and fomo,  I was pressured into doing a second pressing of Cassette w/ Nag Champa which dropped on my birthday, May 23rd 2016. Once again, it sold out immediately and was Bandcamp's best selling cassette for 2 weeks in a row.   Obviously, my most popular / successful instrumental album as Dutchyyy (fka Dutchy) the demand to upload this to streaming was unbearable.  To this Day,  \"Chill Gawd, Chill\" remains only available on bandcamp.  In fall of 2020,  I did one final pressing of the two hour tape w/ Nag Champa.   It was the last time I will press \"this version\" of the cassette.  The problem was,  I pulled 4 songs fromwhat was supposed to be my follow up album \"The Uproot\" and placed them on \"Chill Gawd, Chill\" last minute.  Those songs were \"Evolution of a shrug\" / \"The Scramble\" / \"Lamb's Bread\" (feat. ashtrejinkins & sleepyeyes) and removed a few songs that were created specifically for \"Chill Gawd, Chill\"   this decision derailed the release of \"The Uproot\" which it still remains officially unreleased to this day.  Instead I released \"Traversal\" next,  which is actually the follow up album to the \"The Uproot\".

Whom, like myself, always felt at peace at night when the world was quiet and still.  Happy Mother Day.  \r\n\r\nTrack list:\r\n1.) Nocturnalis I [00:00]\r\n2.) Nocturnalis II [02:21]\r\n3.) Nocturnalis III [06:02]\r\n4.) Debbie. [08:39] \r\n\r\nBackstory:\r\n\r\n   I was living in Los Angeles when my mother Debbie got sick in August of 2016.  She was the text case of a hypochondriac so when she told me,  I basically told her to walk it off in a nice motivational way.  A few days passed and she was admitted to the hospital.  My family all told me the Doctors said she would be fine.  At the time,  I just started a job doing master QC for Netflix.  I was on a probationary period,  living on my friend Josh's couch ( Sunjet /Josh Jetson ) and didn't even have enough money to get back and forth to work yet,  so my mom would PayPal the little money she had to help. A few days passed and mom had to be intubated. Obviously things were more serious than my family led them to be.  My heart was heavy.  I just started this amazing job making $120 hour and all I wanted was to fly home and see my mother,  but my family insisted I focus on the Job my mom was so proud I landed and that it was in my best interest not to see her like this and that the doctors said she will be fine. 2 days later,  My probationary period ended and I finally started getting paid.   I was at work trying to keep my calm & stay positive by listening to Bobby_Hutcherson's \"Nocturnal\" on repeat. My phone abruptly rang and when i picked up  my brother was crying his eyes out.   My heart dropped, He couldn't form many words so He put me on the phone with the doctor. They wanted my permission to take her off life support. At this point, I'm shell-shocked because the last time I spoke with my family, they down played how serious her condition was. The doctor passed the phone to someone specialized in breaking this type of news to people and she tried her hardest to comfort me and advise me that taking her off life support was the best option and what the rest of family already had came to terms with, but i refused..  My mother was full of love and empathy,  she felt this world too deeply and it was difficult for her. As much as she loved us,  she always had a hard time navigating thru this world (The same goes for myself and my brother,  we feel things deeply and always feel out of place).   I was listening to  \"Nocturnal\"  when i got the phone call my mother wasn't going to make it. A song once used to help calm and center me now had this traumatic energy attached to it.  I told my job what was happening and they told me to take a few days off to process.  The next day,  I got an email from my Job saying do not come into work before calling.  Apparently,  it was against policy to take pictures in the building, and I had posted a picture of me at my desk on twitter when i got 1st got hired saying verbatim - \"thank you universe for 2nd chances,  I am eternally grateful\"  - With regret in their voice,  they had to terminate me immediately.  It was a zero tolerance policy.  My boss was crying telling me this, because they grew fond on me my short time with them and I was very very good at my job, plus they knew what I was dealing with, but it was flagged by someone very high up in the chain and no exceptions could be made.  My heart was smashed, I worked so hard to get that job and my mother and family were so proud of me.  I didn't know how to break the news to them.  I just kind of fell to pieces, paralyzed in the motel room I was in.  40 minutes later I got the call.   My mother had passed.  August 19, 2016.      I was on the next flight back to Tampa Bay to help take care of my family and became super numb.  After the celebration of life, I needed to express and grieve in my own way. So the first time i touched music since she passed,  I decided to flip the bobby_hutch sample.   I did it very fast,  didn't overthink or mix it down,  just quickly flipped the sample  uploaded it to soundcloud titled \"I will delete this\" (which i didn't, just changed the track name to \"...\".  The following year on mothers day 2017,  I revisited the o.g. sample and made 2 more flips dedicated to her.  Nocturnalis I, II  and I also recorded a freestyle over one of them (that didn't make it to the ep).  One year later on mothers day 2018,  I revisited it one last time and created Nocturnalis I.\r\n   I haven't ever truly recovered from losing my mother.  My big heart crew cold. The defensive walls I built after such a traumatic experience have never really went away to this day.  I've never officially dropped an album since, like I'm protesting Finality.  The crazy thing is, I've made more music from 2017-present,  then I made from 1995-2016.  Multiple unreleased albums,  changed my entire creative process as therapy and began evolving portals and never stopped.   I hope one day to feel light and at peace again, and I hope where ever you are mom.  You are finally at peace. \r\n\r\nDebbie (May 1st, 1953 - August 19th 2016)\r\n\r\nI love you and miss you so much, you always loved my spacey, sleepy, mellow music, so I know you would sleep to these on repeat. \r\n\r\nEternally....Your Son, Dutch.\r\n  \r\n\r\n ***** I was going to upload this on my mothers birthday, but decided I would wait until mothers day to keep it more consistent with when most of the tracks were created.  I'm not sure if this EP will resonate or be collected anytime soon, but i wanted to pay tribute to my biggest supporter. Once this does get collected. I will revisit the original project file and create \"Nocturalis IV\" and I will contact the person who collects the EP, and mint it for basically the cost of gas so they/you can not only be the first to hear, but also collect it.\r\n\r\n****Collector will receive access to mymaster vault cloud drive titled \"Dutchyyy vs the Algorithms\", with over 110gbs of nearly the full released discography, (1996-future).  Multiple unreleased albums and WIP,  Portals / Evolving Portals (real time sessions, making music from start to end, with the intention of resampling that session in the future and continuously evolving it), side projects, as well as videos posted to my instagram, youtube, and previous twitch vods.  This drive is constantly being updated/added to which will never stop happening.****\r\n\r\n\r\nSidenote: \r\nI used to fight with my mother constantly about engaging on my music posts on facebook with personal stuff.  I was pretty mean about it, and it wasn't until after she passed I found out she created a secret tumblr account ( https://hopefulninja.tumblr.com/ ) so she could keep up with what I was doing and show love.  I cried pretty hard when i found it, cus she just wanted to support me and I was too worried about supporters/fans, seeing a bunch of personal stuff or stalking her page. I had no idea she was on tumblr. I just teared up looking at that page again haha. Fast forward to 2022,  The entire social media space is ruled by engagement, sometimes i feel like karma is haunting me on twitter when i post all this art i'm proud of with nearly 3k followers, and maybe 4 people consistently show up (if they see it) You really don't know what you have til it's gone.  Cherish your loved ones.\r\n\r\nPeacePeace. <3","duration":710.426,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x26ef03a20aaeda8aafcee4e146dc6b328195947c/-mother-nocturalis-ep-1652052419","image":"ipfs://bafkreiht2sfhoqojz5bizge6ut6je4n3d2wa54tbcfasvich6kcwy2d5xm","losslessAudio":"ipfs://bafybeiazhyknt75tqgzqhbiphqkiardm5am7e5tlleb5w36qzsixjf6kuy","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"Dutchyyy - \"Mother\" (Nocturalis) EP","title":"\"Mother\" (Nocturalis) EP","version":"catalog-20220222"}}

My pops who had had not had contact with in over decade saw that I was in NY and invited me to visit him for the weekend in upstate NY.  Reluctantly,  I accepted. I was surprised to learn my father had become the caretaker of the Nature Preserve \"Sam's Point Reserve\" in Craigsmoor NY.   After reconnecting as adults,  we caught up, hashed out previous issues and bonded instantly,  swapping music and stories.  I ended up deciding to stay on the mountain with my pops.  The Nature Preserve was massive, open to public from 8-4pm then after that the whole place was mine to explore.  Coming from Los Angeles where I was overwhelmed with over population, cliche's, politics, trend chasing, etc.  being on a secluded mountain with access to waterfalls, ice caves, etc was just the medicine I needed.  I dropped the 2 HR Cassette \"Chill Gawd, Chill\" which sold out immediately, and Began working on my opus, A return to the spirit of Nature,  \"The Uproot\" & \"Traversal\" were born.  I created so much music I had to split the release into separate albums.    \r\n\"where are we headed\" was created in a way where it doesn't even sound real, but I promise you it is.   One night on a full moon,  I took my laptop and blue tooth speaker to the big open field surrounded by the mountain and set up on a trailer bed.  I thought of how the music scene was shifting from beat scene to dance / future bass and how all my favorite producers stopped sounding like themselves chasing trends and then i channeled that energy under the Full Moon and blacked out getting lost in creation,  when I finally looked up from the blinding laptop screen,  I saw I was surrounded by like 40 pairs of glowing eyes,  I was terrified,  until I turned the flashlight on to find out that I had Pied piper a parcel of Deer.   They where all sitting and surrounding me watching me and listening to this song being created.

I had just inherited a painting by Gino Hollander, a painting that I had grown up with and loved dearly. I placed this painting in front of me at my studio, and before I could think, a series of soft eighth notes escaped my fingers. I spent the following 3 months turning that initial idea into the piece it is today. This is my genesis NFT as well as my first true example of art music, as the majority of my compositions have only danced around the idea. This concept of art music, and its origin within the concept of ekphrasis, is one that I’ve been gripped by... I personally find nothing more rewarding then to seek out meaning within the story, and transliterate that into music. So, this piece, Desiderium, after Gino Hollander’s 1994 ‘Untitled’, is the story that I hear. I hope it touches you.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Elliot Cole [elliotcole.eth], for the guidance within this burgeoning space and for making my genesis drop on Catalog a reality, as well as Siri Hollander, for granting permission to use images of her late father’s work.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUNDS USED\r\n\r\nVioloncello I: Niles Luther\r\nVioloncello II: Niles Luther\r\n\r\nPiano I: Spitfire Audio [Olafur Arnalds Felt Grand Piano]\r\nPiano II: Signature Sam Samples [Signature Grand]\r\n\r\nOrchestra: Spitfire Audio [Appassionata Strings]\r\n\r\n808: FutureAudioWorkshop [SubLab]\r\n\r\n\r\nPAINTING DETAILS\r\n\r\nTitle: Untitled\r\nArtist: Gino Hollander\r\nMedium: Oil on Canvas\r\nYear of Work: 1994\r\nSize: 48 x 48 in","duration":493.416,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x76f634ec8366bdbc8ed1a050afc3b9b9324d5f26/desiderium-1655920189","image":"ipfs://QmUiYRnvwxQS5sG32FRf5qJG3rzSJwrR9h2vNbeKVmjrAt","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmPnFoWDNAYJgMeo7mV4QuCRYSigm2ezN5LFCitFMPA13q","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"Niles Luther - Desiderium","title":"Desiderium","version":"catalog-20220222"}}

Included in the primary auction is a custom merchandise package and two tickets to any Dot show (festivals excluded). \r\n\r\n50% of profits from the \"Early Days\" series will also be donated to the National Network of Abortion Funds, and to Planned Parenthood. Please find my statement on the issue below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's taken me some time to speak up about the Supreme Court leaked draft decision to overturn Roe v. Wade -- words like \"saddened,\" \"disgusted,\" or \"horrified\" don't begin to cover the ranges of emotions I've felt since reading abortion rights headlines day after day. It's hard for me to gather thoughts on an issue that seems completely illogical. \r\n\r\nWomen have the right to choose what to do with their bodies. Women have the right to decide if and when they want to be mothers. Women's access to basic healthcare is not up for debate. I KNOW that women have the same basic human rights as all people on this planet, regardless of what few individuals in power or larger institutions may try to do to suppress that right. This is a truth that I will continue to live by, and continue to fight for no matter the situation. \r\n\r\nMy performance in Los Angeles last week was one of the more difficult sets I've had in recent memory. Playing music and connecting with people is usually my favorite thing in the world, but I couldn't shake this shadow of awareness that according to many institutions, I don't have the same rights as my male peers on that same stage. And this privilege of getting up in front of audiences to share music that I created is something that very few women have access to. \r\n\r\nA USC study completed in 2020 showed that less than 2% of music producers in the industry are women, and while this number may be shocking to some, it makes perfect sense to me when you consider the centuries of oppression and violence against us that continue to seep into modern politics and healthcare practices. If we want to see more women excel in music (or any field), we must address the underlying issues that keep us from living our lives as equals instead of subordinates. \r\n\r\nToday I'm launching a new series of music NFTs on Catalog titled \"Early Days\" of music I released on Soundcloud from 2012-2018, and I'm donating 50% of all sales from this series to the National Network of Abortion Funds, and to Planned Parenthood. Soundcloud was extremely important to me as a young female producer, and was one of the first community-driven platforms to give me a voice and enable me to share my music with thousands of people before I had any sort of following or cosign. These early releases opened so many doors for me  that I would not have had access to otherwise (like getting discovered and reposted by Soulection, creating Team Supreme with my friends, and giving one of my instrumentals to SZA as an unknown producer), so it feels right to me that a significant portion of profits from that music should be invested in women's rights. \r\n\r\nWith love and compassion,\r\n\r\nDot","duration":243.278,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x92526b99715afeed324fb56ecafcac8056379300/super-moon-1652470060","image":"ipfs://bafkreictacy43lz6ftnxsjpn5tzoasw2guaa6avgns4otuvrotolb633ia","losslessAudio":"ipfs://bafybeiev4dtew5s6wwalfnhzhtta465owhbrmjrmuxa5ybihkhj4k6e4wi","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"dot - Super Moon","title":"Super Moon","version":"catalog-20220222"}}

The album's creative life span started as early as 2013 while still living in my first apartment in Los Angeles.  The creation of \"Traversal\" would run parallel to the creation of \"Chill Gawd, Chill\" and more significantly, \"The Uproot\".  Spanning multiple states and multiple environments / situations that all inspired these sessions in very different but equally profound ways.  After leaving Los Angeles abruptly in early 2014, I jettisoned back to Tampa, FL to be met with extreme heartbreak and disappointment, quickly reminding me when I moved away in the first place.  Fate would extend it's hand in the form of a long time fan & friend of a lot of rappers in my immediate & extended family tree (Demigodz, AOTP,  etc) reaching out and offering an escape hatch to NY to get off the couch I was surfing on in Tampa and come stay a few months in #Yetiville where I would have my own room and access to a studio upstairs. The condition was that I have to write & record a song for his album/mixtape. \r\n\r\nhttps://samthesleezbag.bandcamp.com/album/sleezbagmekalektape\r\n\r\n I agreed and was on a plane to NY a few days later.  It was dope living in this multi-story 5 bedroom house on hill surrounded and secluded by trees (Lord Digga named that house Yetiville because it was hidden and only accessible by a long narrow dirt road)  Keep in mind, at this point (spring/summer 2014) I had not released an album as Dutchmassive since 2008.  I was not rapping,  I was in my producer bag and that bag wasn't always typical boom-bap beats either.  I make a lot of music and I'm not always trying to make \"beats\" or at least not ones that traditional 90's hip-hop fans would care about.  I was also at the peak of my trauma & anxiety from what happened prior in LA & Tampa,  So I wasn't really in the mode of the \"Dutchmassive\" that all these rappers on the east coast remember as,  The over-confident, call em out, battle rapper from the Mid/late 90's was not in building to say the least.  On top of that,  I evolved from that version of myself shortly after releasing my Debut album \"Junk Planet\" anyway.  My sophomore album on Rawkus \"Crush Your System\" was crafted with more humility and responsibility so even If I wasn't shaken up by traumatic events.  I don't know how or why anyone expected me to channel that younger version of myself.  Over the next few months, I did song's with Lord Digga,  started an album entirely produced by Apathy (Demigodz) all while taking moments to myself to escape and  hide while having existential crisis and channel that energy into what came natural to me, making beats.  I made \"Lua Cheia (f/ Kaelin Ellis)\" on my laptop,  sitting in a lawn chair, hidden in the forest.   I made \"Analysis Paralysis\" outside on the front porch at like 4am during one of the only times in Life I ever thought about taking my own life just to stop feeling this extremely heavy weight I couldn't seem to shake.  In other words,  while trying to be the Dutch all my Hip Hop friends wanted to be again,  I had to sneak time to make the genuine and unconventional music I really desired to create.  Late summer, at the turn of Autumn.  My Pops who I had not really had contact with for well over a decade reached out since he saw I was in NY.  He wanted me to come visit him for the weekend a few hours north of where I was living.....\r\n\r\nACT II: Long Story Short.  I've covered a bit of this Arc in previous backstories on my records on Catalog Works so to condense this a bit.\r\nThis Article will fill in some of the blanks so I can bring this story to its neatly wrapped up resolve.\r\n\r\nhttps://mecca83.com/2020/05/shawangunk-stomp-the-story-of-dutchyyys-uproot/\r\n\r\nACT III:  Everything is connected and has purpose, even the Chaos\r\n\r\nIn spring of 2015, my secluded mountain, return to nature healing Arc came to a close.  I had to once again return back to Tampa Bay after a Year of peace of self discovery in a magical place I never wanted to leave.  When I arrived in Tampa,  it rained for 32 days straight......  and I mean non-stop.  So all I could do was create in doors,  back on the same friends couch I jettisoned from in the first place.  Thankfully my friend, while not a musician himself, shares the same love and taste in music as I do.  So I was able to create minus any pressures or judgements allowing me to continue experimenting and pushing my limits.   \r\n\r\nI already messed up \"The Uproot\" by removing 4 specific tracks intended for that album and throwing them on \"Chill Gawd, Chill\" and what was originally intended to be A Double album \"The Uproot / Traversal\" ended up with a different fate.  The laptop I created most of The Uproot was destroyed by water damage.  So I held off on releasing that album and decided to release just \"Traversal\" and release it out of the intended order by releasing it first.  I had too many songs stacked up,  So I knew I could only fit one more song but knowing that.  I really wanted to create the last song with intention, when the energy felt right.   On July 7th, 2015 I opened up Ableton.  I knew which sample would end this album,  I did the normal boring prep work, finding drums, getting the sample ready and something felt off.   It was ridiculously hot & humid and there was no way I wanted to end this album attached to Florida summer memories. If you are confused about this sentiment,  I invite you to let me explain further in form of lyrics:\r\n\r\nhttps://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/track/ajar-produced-by-redacted-2011\r\n\r\nDid you listen to the link above?  Make more sense now?  If not, it's ok I'll continue anyway. \r\n\r\nJuly,  August,  September,  October...   months and months go by and global warming is a bitch.   It felt like Autumn would never come.  Then on October 24th 2015,  The first chilly breeze was felt.  It was now time,  Opened all the doors and windows and embraced the fresh air and then I opened up the project file I started back in July.   The cool weather didn't last long but I was already committed and on October 29th 2015, I Finalized and Exported the track.\r\n\r\nSo why the elaborate backstory just to get to a song I waited for a specific season to create?\r\n\r\nThe Theme of my life and fueled by specific parts of that story is,  I began creating music in the mid 90's.   I was birthed from Golden Era HipHop & Jazz.  It's what a very large portion of my long term fanbase expects and wants from me,  but I'm not just a Boombap lover.   I spend more time listening to Video Game Ost's,  obscure library music than I do listening to hip hop or beats.  It's harder to tell who inspired me more,  DJ Premier or Portishead haha..  So Traversal has a lot of music that doesn't fit that classic hip hop vibe that I know people expected from me.  So I wanted to end the album by creating an ode to an Era and expectations, with love, sincerity and optimism,  I had to Set my Intentions while completely freeing myself from that day forward of anyone's expectations.  \r\nand thus \"Set Your Intentions\" was born.\r\n\r\n*****Anyone who bids on this auction will receive a link to my master cloud based vault \"Dutchyyy vs the Algorithms\" of nearly my full released and unreleased discography.  *****","duration":230.557,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x26ef03a20aaeda8aafcee4e146dc6b328195947c/set-your-intentions-1658687655","image":"ipfs://QmfMu3zDC485PCJi7e6AjSvB8NVrHsMGKVLWocnU7u4gpF","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmXomvmQXVxe3CcYAX1GiubqqNy5h1mxTFM18NNHcQroFz","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"Dutchyyy - Set Your Intentions","project":{"artwork":{"uri":"ipfs://QmfMu3zDC485PCJi7e6AjSvB8NVrHsMGKVLWocnU7u4gpF","mimeType":"image/png"},"title":"Traversal","description":"\"Set Your Intentions\" - Produced by Dutchyyy\r\n\r\n\"Traversal\" ended up seeing two separate releases, each with slight variations.  \r\n\r\nThe Original version that I released digitally on bandcamp and all streaming services in Winter of 2015 (which was the first and last album I ever uploaded to the streaming services) \r\n[ https://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/traversal ]\r\n\r\nand the cassette version released in Winter of 2016 via Grand Garden Records.  \r\n[https://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/traversal-grand-garden]"},"title":"Set Your Intentions","trackNumber":4,"version":"catalog-20220222"}}

Given all that is happening in the world and how the markets feel right now, I thought instead of my usual spacey, abstract or more heavy tracks,  I'd upload something that has a chance of lifting people up.   \r\n\r\nBackstory:  The instrumental was made early 2010, on FL Studio while getting some sun at the pool.  Originally titled \"A day at the pool\" and released on \"Yawn of the Gemini\" (May 23rd, 2010 / My Birthday)  [ https://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/yawn-of-the-gemini-2005-2010 ] This was one of my no samples, practice beats.  Back then, and still to this day,  I would/will alternate and dedicate different days to different methods of production,  I.E.  \"loops only day\",  \"Microchops day\",  \"No samples day\".  Then one day early 2015,  my homie C M O sent me an unsolicited email with a demo version of this song attached.  I was blown away, that he turned something that I considered a throwaway beat and turned it into such beautiful introspective opus.  So I told him, that I was in the process of releasing my new album \"Traversal\" and the next day,  he sent me this version.  \r\n\r\n\"Traversal\" ended up seeing two separate releases, each with slight variations.  \r\n\r\nThe Original version that I released digitally on bandcamp and all streaming services in Winter of 2015 (which was the first and last album I ever uploaded to the streaming services) \r\n[ https://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/traversal ]\r\n\r\nand the cassette version released in Winter of 2016 via Grand Garden Records.  \r\n[https://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/traversal-grand-garden]\r\n\r\nThe album was too long to fit on a 90 minute cassette,  So I took that as a opportunity to make the cassette version different from the digital version. Different track order, Different master, and A few Different tracks in general.  So the digital version has a few songs that aren't on the cassette version,  and the cassette version has a few songs that aren't on the original digital version.   The cassette allowed me to really refine and sequence the album how I truly wanted it to be digested in full so personally,  I love the cassette version more.  but tracks like \"Esoteric\" didn't make it on to the cassette, along with \"The Chop & the Loop\", \"Dimples\",  \"Please Take Care\" (of yourself), \"64\" & the 3 Bonus tracks featuring my friends Toonorth & Sunjet,  which were just 3 different versions of my remixing my homie Apathy's song \"Chemical\"\r\n\r\n****I hope \"Esoteric\" provides you some healthy escapism. and as always.

With this remix I wanted to approach it as a collaborative process rather than just \"my take\" on the original song.  My initial idea was to take the majority of the Midnight Snacks series and try to compose one NEW idea stemming from my fav bits of the whole shabang.  I realized VERY quickly this was going to be too difficult to make something I love for the remix contest timeline (merp).  As a result what I settled on was trying to flip a song that was composed stylistically very opposite of what I do well; tempo being the easy contrast to work with.  I landed on Joysful Resistance Part 1 - already the had lyrics written in the title.  I treated MdCL's masterful piano parts as a \"hook\"; cutting/stretching/warping them into submission to try and fit the new tempo I was working with.  From there it was all about setting the intention around the groove.  Make ish' dance-able.  I actually worked a number of hours on the song on my twitch stream one day and as a result one of my homies/followers; percussionist Stingray from NY, was inspired and on the spot sent me a congo solo; which I messaged into the song real time (which did make the final mix).  It was at this point that I could not escape the \"live\" feeling both the original song and my new remix was asking of the production.  I recorded airy, dubby vocals to really drive something new making use of the song's title.  The vocals and reworked piano parts then gave me the shape for my arrangement; from there I multi tracked all the drums and percussion parts live that I felt like needed more organic movement.  Lastly; I was left with adding a bit of  jazz back into the song.  I contacted organ player, Abel Boquera, delivered instructions and then comp'd probably a solid 30+ minutes of organ parts to shape what you hear in the final.

This one is quite special...\r\n\r\nBackstory:\r\n\r\nPicture a man strong of heart, but nearly broken. Vulnerable but unwavering as he summons as much strength as he can to fight and not crumble under his own weight or the weight of his circumstances. To reclaim his peace. To reclaim his personal power.\r\n\r\nIn that process of alignment - in learning and unlearning, there is true freedom in unapologetically following the heart. It is a path that perhaps provides a shortcut to happiness and fulfillment, but is far from easy. Nonetheless, one never truly loses in loving, living their purpose or being themselves. This is difficult to see at times. Though, that’s where inner fortitude, faith and persistence come in.\r\n\r\nDrawing from personal experience, this piece is a depiction of such a journey. While playing a show in Palmdale, California with a wonderful group “Dean Mucetti and the Rhythm Real” in April 2022, I was suddenly asked to perform solo in the middle of the set, since we were flying through it rather quickly.\r\n\r\nBeing where I was mentally, physically and spiritually at the time, I was pensive and felt exposed. Though, there was no time to think. I took a deep breath to connect to my heart space. This is what poured out from me.","duration":365.61,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0xec29fd9fd64eb43a53f6917137355144ed5a3b8d/heart-1656519938","image":"ipfs://QmRgqc664wUioRJxm72U3owNTGjiMZ4fXRqHjF11oK77vR","losslessAudio":"ipfs://Qmc8p1FcNATyu9amdhf5zrsdm9QuJedfMaV1ZHUpeg7S9d","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"Brian Hargrove - Heart","title":"Heart","version":"catalog-20220222"}}

I took the leap and decided to move to Los Angeles after taking what was supposed to be a 4-6 month long contract teaching at Cedars-Sinai Hospital.  Unfortunately, we taught them too well & too fast and the contract was cut short, only lasting a few weeks.  I was already committed to making Los Angeles my home but now I was limited on funds, and about to lose the hotel I was supposed to be at for months while searching for apartments, but As fate would have it,  I was about to get a life raft.  After jokingly posting on Facebook,  \"I'm hungry, someone bring me some food\".   Someone commented, \"You're in Los Angles?  I'm a huge fan of your music and my family owns a restaurant\".  It was my day off, so I commented. \"Come Scoop\" jokingly, not realizing he would want to follow through.   Long Story Short,  We became good friends and that night would change the course of my life.  Meeting multiple strangers who became best friends. When the contract ended.  My new friend (Anthony) allowed me to stay with him while I searched for a place to move into.   During this time, I taught him and a few of his friends (who are now my close friends) how to use FL Studio.  He was a huge fan of my music,  so I played him a bunch of unreleased music I never planned on releasing.  He lost his mind when I was adamant about never releasing the music I was playing him.   What he didn't know was a few months prior on Xmas night 2011,  My Laptop filled with my upcoming Dutchmassive album titled \"Romanticizing\" along with every beat I made from 2008-xmas 2011 was lost when hard drive got corrupted and dealt me the dreaded Blue Screen Of Death.  I didn't have any of it backed up on extra hard drives.  All that remained from 2008-2011 was the crappy first draft versions I burned to CD's for \"The Car Test\" and well,  I didn't take care of those either so they all had scratches and were sun damaged.  So the things I was playing him,  where unfinalized early versions of songs that I know became so much greater than the versions I was left with.  He wouldn't take no for an answer and eventually offered to pay my 1st month's rent and my security deposit if I swallowed my pride and uploaded the few early versions I salvaged to bandcamp. He didn't want any profits from it, he just wanted those songs to exist online and be heard by the public. I agreed and moved into my new apartment a few miles down the road from him.  Shortly after moving into my new place overlooking the port of Los Angeles,  My friend Angel (Kronika) introduced me to another producer who went by the name Ahwlee.  \r\n\r\nBackstory: ACT III\r\n\r\nAhwlee & I vibed pretty quickly. He would come stay at my apartment and make entire EP's on Ableton Live in one night and not even save what he made. He deleted some of the best beats I've ever heard and he did this frequently. While I was taking all night on a single flips that I would maybe finish at a later date.\r\n \r\n\r\nSo one night A few days before my birthday, while he was knocking out an entire EP in Ableton Live,\r\nhttps://bumps.bandcamp.com/album/dutchist\r\n\r\nand I was stuck working on one single song in FL Studio.\r\nhttps://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/track/anglwngs\r\n\r\nI thought to myself \"How is able to knock out fully fleshed out albums during the same time it takes me to finish one song\" Later that night,  I said \"enough is enough, teach me Ableton please!\"  So he taught me everything he knew and the next day we made the song \"Medutayshun\" with Ahwlee on the drums and synths and me chopping on Ableton for the 1st time.\r\n\r\n\"https://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/track/medutayshun-f-ahwlee\r\n\r\nThis would be the beginning of a new chapter for me.  I was very proficient in Ableton and could never go back to the slow and limited work flow I had while working in FL Studio.  I wanted to make one final beat in Fruity loops and then close the book on my FL Studio Arc for good.  So I made one final song in FL Studio on my birthday May 23rd 2012. titled \"Just Be Yourself\"\r\n\r\nhttps://beta.catalog.works/dutchyyy/-just-be-yourself-\r\n\r\nA few months went by, and I was countless tracks in using Ableton.  I truly got distracted and got lost in a new extended burst of creative energy. Until one day, I believe it was rent day so September 1st if I'm remembering correctly, Anthony reminded me that I still owed him that album of unreleased tracks from my old hard drive that needed to be uploaded to Bandcamp.  \r\n\r\nMost of the songs were too badly damaged by scratches in the CD or sunspots so I salvaged what I could, I added a few beats I made in FL studio after moving to Los Angeles. Then, on September 12th, 2012 I reluctantly uploaded the album \"Blue Screen of Deaf\".  \r\n\r\nhttps://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/blue-screen-of-deaf-2011-2012\r\n\r\nNever touching FL Studio again, becoming an Ableton main and moving to the next chapter creating what would later become the 2 hour Cassette \"Chill Gawd, Chill\"\r\n\r\n- Closing -\r\n\r\nThis backstory was pretty lengthy, and covered a lot of info that I would have preferred to reveal in future back stories for songs like \"ANGLWNGS\" or even \"Medutayshun\" (f/ Ahwlee) because the bulk of story revolves around those songs more than it does to \"insane go all don't we If\" but the reality is,  This song would have never been released to the public,  especially since it's an early, unfinished version of the song like 95% of \"Blue Screen of Deaf\" is.

I was jumping and bobbing around for weeks making this. I love to take art + music super seriously, but it's also just as important to just have fun for no reason other than enjoying making something cool. \r\n\r\nI also designed the cover art, and had just as much fun making that as the song. I just kept stacking more and more shapes on top of each other. I think the art has ~300 layers if I recall?

Its location is a mystery.\r\n\r\n// Station 2 // Field Notes\r\n\r\nThe lullaby describes “The Undersea Carousel” with a hallowed air, its lyrics illustrating in gorgeous detail not only the legendary object, but also the wonder and fortune bestowed upon whomever might encounter it.\r\n\r\nCuriously, though the song is well-known, especially in rural areas, we found it quite difficult to ask about its truth and history. We attempted questions about whether the carousel actually exists, on which planet it might be, around when it might have last been visited, and so on – and were unable to find residents who had any interest in discussing such matters.\r\n\r\nOne group of elders suggested, not without twinkles in their eyes, that if we wanted to know more about the carousels (notably, spoken of in the plural), we should ask Thuvratioow. This is the nickname of an old god no longer worshipped, who last held sway some sixty thousand years ago, when none of the outer Pleiades had yet been inhabited.\r\n\r\nWe began to discern a collective understanding among the Pleiadians, that these mysteries were themselves part of the lore. That such secrets held beauty, and even commanded power, in remaining secret. That inquiries made in pursuit of precision could, in certain situations, prevent the attainment of a greater knowledge.\r\n\r\nAt least, the puzzle of the song's story is perhaps outdone by the story surrounding the song.\r\n\r\n// Station 3 // Collector Perks\r\n\r\nThis is a 1/1 Catalog NFT track composed, performed, and pressed by Eric Pan (pandelic.eth).\r\n\r\nEvery owner of a pandelic.eth Catalog NFT also receives unlimited, “golden ticket” download access to Eric's entire published music catalog, in resolutions up to MP3 V0 and lossless WAV.

LULLABIES OF THE PLEIADES collects six solo piano pieces transcribed from indigenous Pleiadian songs, each as sung to a young loved one, local to the far constellation. \r\n\r\nThis exoplanetary musicology project aims to amplify previously undocumented music and its connected folklore, with more research findings to come.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nfield notes excerpt 1. origins\r\n\r\nthe Pleiadians became aware, early on, of their role as beacon and source of wonder. That anyone who saw their bouquet of stars, no matter how distant, would thereafter look to them in search for answers. That they would be listened to—and so what they say should not lead the rest of us astray.\r\n\r\nSwift was their realization that music was the ideal language to communicate wishes, context, and emotion. and so naturally the songs they played for each other carried the same glowing power when broadcast outward, for anyone who didn’t understand their spoken languages.\r\n\r\nThe lullaby is complete.\r\n\r\nA self-contained intention.\r\n\r\n(A gift and a blessing.)\r\n\r\nthe deep care of a lullaby is transmitted across time, across distances so vast that years are needed for light to bridge the gap.\r\n\r\n“I’ll sing to you, so that you might find peace more easily.”\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nfield notes excerpt 2. journey to earth\r\n\r\nAll composition is ethnomusicology, if you’re lucky.\r\n\r\nWhile I cannot vouch for my own luck, and I cannot be certain I have transcribed these Pleiadian lullabies with sufficient accuracy — such that the Pleiadians themselves could still feel their full import — I have tried my best for now. I have sensed that the piano, as an instrument, is unfamiliar to them, but in the end is serviceable for the purposes of transcription.\r\n\r\nGathering the songs began with a process of sitting in stillness, the better by which to detect currents in the air. Then, like sifting particles of sand lifted by wind, I could listen for patterns, the frequencies scattered and embedded in shared consciousness, the imprint of grooves left from countless repetitions of the same gestures of care, given and then continuously passed along. an ancient and timeless wisdom. The endless circulation of blood through the body is an apt metaphor for the rejuvenating effect of songs repeated and echoed across time.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nfield notes excerpt 3. the increase\r\n\r\nI am hard-pressed to identify when, exactly, this collection of songs changed me. I had felt that the transmission was complete, at least for the time being. As I played and re-played them for myself, familiarizing my ears and listening for what messages they spoke, I came to realize that each lullaby held ever deeper secrets that I felt unable to plumb.\r\n\r\n…a different day, performing a different one, with a different disposition, might reveal a new facet of a song, the way an answer might glimmer from the depths of a gemstone with light shone upon it, precisely angled — though in the case of this music, perhaps not to be found again.\r\n\r\nThe whole of each lullaby was beyond my comprehension, and my efforts to document or understand their meaning seemed thwarted at every renewed attempt, as if to be told: “What you seek cannot be found here.”\r\n\r\n+\r\ngradually I came to realize that my exploration of this music would change dramatically between renditions, especially contrasting playing alone against playing for others.\r\n+ it might not be the lullabies themselves which hold power but the act of giving them.\r\n\r\nit is now clear to me … the stability and longevity of these lullabies depends upon passing them on. They have arrived at our present place and time due to each sharing that came before, from one caretaker to a loved one, a gifting of heart and time cupped with both hands.\r\n\r\nThis awareness has brought me to an imperative — that I let go of the Lullabies of the Pleiades, as well as the need to keep them close to me, for intimate study, as if I’d isolated them to petri dishes. It is better that I give them out, and not reservedly, but with clarion gusto. (this step also makes it possible for anyone else to take these songs of care, understand and even transform them in their own way: sing them to another, releasing them into freedom again, increasing their potency with each gifting."},"title":"The Undersea Carousel","trackNumber":4,"version":"catalog-20220222"}}

At the time, I was out of town on A contract, teaching  at the hospital but I listened on my break and sent her back a message on IG. Letting her know I loved what I heard and added my critiques on the mixing.  She recorded over two  beats that were already officially released on my album/cassette, so I didn't put too much thought into it.  A few months later in March 2017  I asked if she minded if I posted one of the songs on my Soundcloud on her birthday: https://soundcloud.com/dutchmassive/mousey-mcglynn-adult-prod-by-dutchy-niceguy-x-vinny\r\n\r\nMsMMMcG did a lot of live performances so I told her that she can record vocals over any song of mine that inspires her.  Months passed and she said she wanted to record enough tracks for an EP. I said that's fine, as long as I can mix the vocals to my beats. She ended up choosing more beats from albums that have already been released, so I said I'm cool with the EP being a free promo thing because I personally didn't want to monetize tracks that I've already released and made money from. More time passed, she would send vocals as she recorded them but I was in the process of working on two new albums and a side project when I was home, and I was out of state traveling teaching at hospitals every other month, So admittedly, I was super busy and I procrastinated on mixing the tracks, until she lit a fire under me letting me know she wanted to shoot multiple videos for the songs.  When it came to mixing \"Song4u\" one of the songs she wanted to shoot a video for,  I realized she recorded her vocals over the Soundcloud / demo version of the instrumental \"Set Your Intentions\"  (from Traversal) So when I brought the vocals into my Ableton Live session to mix them, nothing properly line up.  So I had to do some finessing,  while also multi-tasking a few other deadlines I had to finish before leaving for my next out of state contract.  Sent out a few different versions, more time passed, and I finally agreed to her releasing the EP on Bandcamp & Streaming.  She was insistent on splitting any profits 50/50 but I declined and told her not to worry about splits because I still felt weird about double monetizing my beats. (I know, I know... I'm not the most business savvy artist on the planet)\r\n\r\nIn April of 2019 she released the \"Dutchess EP\" on bandcamp & Streaming\r\n\r\nDUTCHESS EP LINK: https://msmmmcg.bandcamp.com/album/dutchess-ep\r\n\r\nAlso releasing 3 videos from the EP throughout 2019,  One of which being \"Song4U\".\r\nVIDEO LINK: \r\nhttps://youtu.be/STg6K76aTWI\r\n\r\nThe more you know:\r\nThe Instrumental used for this song is from the 2015 album \"Traversal\" and it's originally titled \"Set Your Intentions\".\r\nhttps://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/track/set-your-intensions\r\n\r\n*****Anyone who bids on this auction will receive a link to my master cloud based vault \"Dutchyyy vs the Algorithms\" of nearly my full released and unreleased discography.  *****","duration":214.909,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x26ef03a20aaeda8aafcee4e146dc6b328195947c/-song4u-f-msmmmcg--1658678429","image":"ipfs://QmT77AfQmCQoQr3qbzsWosDMDh7FwkacQmkQ6sZmHGohVb","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmeqVdouck6fPKhRYSPnurQbwCP2dE9VcnUGJmBn6m94nB","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"Dutchyyy - \"Song4u\" (f/  MsMMMcG)","project":{"artwork":{"uri":"ipfs://QmT77AfQmCQoQr3qbzsWosDMDh7FwkacQmkQ6sZmHGohVb","mimeType":"image/png"},"title":"Dutchess EP","description":"\"Song4u\"\r\nProduced by: Dutchyyy\r\nVocals Written & Performed by: MsMMMcG (aka Margaret \"Mousey\" McGlynn)\r\n\r\nhttps://msmmmcg.bandcamp.com/album/dutchess-ep"},"title":"\"Song4u\" (f/  MsMMMcG)","trackNumber":7,"version":"catalog-20220222"}}

Wade -- words like \"saddened,\" \"disgusted,\" or \"horrified\" don't begin to cover the ranges of emotions I've felt since reading abortion rights headlines day after day. It's hard for me to gather thoughts on an issue that seems completely illogical. \r\n\r\nWomen have the right to choose what to do with their bodies. Women have the right to decide if and when they want to be mothers. Women's access to basic healthcare is not up for debate. I KNOW that women have the same basic human rights as all people on this planet, regardless of what few individuals in power or larger institutions may try to do to suppress that right. This is a truth that I will continue to live by, and continue to fight for no matter the situation. \r\n\r\nMy performance in Los Angeles last week was one of the more difficult sets I've had in recent memory. Playing music and connecting with people is usually my favorite thing in the world, but I couldn't shake this shadow of awareness that according to many institutions, I don't have the same rights as my male peers on that same stage. And this privilege of getting up in front of audiences to share music that I created is something that very few women have access to. \r\n\r\nA USC study completed in 2020 showed that less than 2% of music producers in the industry are women, and while this number may be shocking to some, it makes perfect sense to me when you consider the centuries of oppression and violence against us that continue to seep into modern politics and healthcare practices. If we want to see more women excel in music (or any field), we must address the underlying issues that keep us from living our lives as equals instead of subordinates. \r\n\r\nToday I'm launching a new series of music NFTs on Catalog titled \"Early Days\" of music I released on Soundcloud from 2012-2018, and I'm donating 50% of all sales from this series to the National Network of Abortion Funds, and to Planned Parenthood. Soundcloud was extremely important to me as a young female producer, and was one of the first community-driven platforms to give me a voice and enable me to share my music with thousands of people before I had any sort of following or cosign. These early releases opened so many doors for me  that I would not have had access to otherwise (like getting discovered and reposted by Soulection, creating Team Supreme with my friends, and giving one of my instrumentals to SZA as an unknown producer), so it feels right to me that a significant portion of profits from that music should be invested in women's rights. \r\n\r\nWith love and compassion,\r\n\r\nDot","duration":186.149,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x92526b99715afeed324fb56ecafcac8056379300/hazel-1656971619","image":"ipfs://Qmcy5KmzUBJGP9qCyk5JK5SqheWrmt1pkJfMkj9nm3J6DS","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmYMNyr4zrxuEAXcmTaAw3S5xAwmVrMc192xbLGws81gAw","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"dot - Hazel","title":"Hazel","version":"catalog-20220222"}}

Released world wide July 13, 2004 on CD / 2xLP.  \r\nFor context, I began writing and recording for Junk Planet late 1997 while also recording an album with my group at the time \"Equilibrium\" (Celph Titled, Majik Most & Myself) and finished recording the the last song for Junk Planet in 2002.  Time moved slower for music back then. There was no \"keeping up with daily content\".  You had the freedom to live and experience life and use that experience for inspiration to craft well thought out albums.\r\n   \r\n   I was taking my time recording my sophomore album \"Crush Your System\" An album I began writing & recording for in 2003, which would later be released on Rawkus Records as part of worlds first digital only campaign \"The Rawkus 50\" but i'm getting sidetracked.\r\n \r\nTaking my time, building an arsenal up of production from my favorite producers at the time:  Samiyam, 14KT, Take, Dakim, !llmind, Dela, SlopFunkDust, Mo0, etc... All friends I made through the power of Myspace.   I had just released my first official instrumental project titled \"The Drumlove EP\" as well as the mixtape \"Project: REACH\" when Take (Sweaton Klank) sent me the perfect beat.  He was able to match my voice and style so well,  but instead of me using the beat on my upcoming album he wanted me to be the only emcee to feature on his debut full length.  The pressure of knowing I would be the only person rapping on this album made me take writing this song very serious.  I didn't want to just do some typical braggadocios battle rap since I knew the album was going to more like a movie score in a sense rather than just a collection of random beats.   At the time,  I was dating a girl who was very inspirational and had me exploring things outside of my normal wheelhouse.  She had perfect recall when it came to dreaming and was able to lucid dream with ease. So the months leading up to writing \"Dream Suite\" I had been using a dream journal every morning and studying Astral Projection and Lucid dreaming in general.  Something I've only ever been able to achieve a few times in my lifetime and once I realized I was in control,  I would immediately wake up haha.  So I decided to make Lucid dreaming the subject matter for the song I was going to write.  Nearly everything I wrote about was true to form and directly inspired by the research I had been doing.  I did take one creative liberty and changed \"Greek Dream Temples\" to the inaccurate \"Egyptian Dream Temples\" but that's because I was obsessed with the Mysteries of Ancient Egypt since I was a child and thought Egyptian sounded \"cooler\" than saying \"Greek\".  Plus I needed a word with multiple syllables haha.  I recorded, mixed and mastered my vocals and sent them off to Take (Sweatson Klank) - The beat I wrote to was just a rough sketch, so when he sent me the final version with all the change up's and the outro that transports you to a different world.  I don't know what else to say.  This became one of my favorite tracks of all time, and I couldn't believe I was lucky enough to be apart of it.   \r\n\r\nYears later,  long after \"Crush Your System\" was released on Rawkus,  I released an updated version on bandcamp with added songs (since my 3rd solo album as Dutchmassive titled \"Romanticizing\" was lost on Xmas 2011 to corrupt hard drive resulting in the dreaded \"Blue Screen of Death\")  After losing all of my beats from 2008-2011 and the album I spent years writing and recording.   I just took a few extra songs I featured on, added them to Crush Your System and decided to hang up the mic and focus primarily on Production moving forward.   I know, I know, what a sad ending haha,  but truth is,  I'm an emcee at heart, so I never stopped rhyming.  I just stopped writing and recording albums.  Instead,  I began recording freestyles daily for fun.  What started out on voice memos,  graduated to a Tascam DR-05 in 2015.  The creative fulfillment that came with recording freestyles for fun without the pressure of them ever being heard was the ultimate therapy and would get me thru the toughest of days while also having fun keeping the spirit of the emcee alive 2015-present and thus was born DailyRambles aka \"The Reluctant Clap\"   \r\n\r\nThis Catalog Record is a 50/50 split with @sweatsonklank \r\nI wanted my Genesis drop as \"Dutchmassive\" to feature another Catalog Artist and it just worked out that one of my favorite songs I've recorded to date was produced by a producer who also an artist on Catalog Works =)\r\n\r\n*****Winner of this auction will receive A copy of \"Earthtones & Concrete\" on CD (Digipack) & 2xLP (Vinyl) from our personal collections*****\r\n\r\n*****Anyone who bids on this auction will receive a link to my master cloud based vault \"Dutchyyy vs the Algorithms\" of nearly my full released and unreleased discography over 110gb *****\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n*****Winner of the auction will get a 1TB Samsung SSD portable drive that not only holds everything on the cloud drive,  but all the Portals unreleased in super long raw form directly from their master folders strait from the SP404SX and All the long videos and twitch streams that are too large to upload anywhere*****","duration":303.282,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0xad04cd3c5f71d5f4a1a5ba0de5c749818055d1c7/-dream-suite-prod-by-sweatson-klank-1657628479","image":"ipfs://QmQANi1dBV84dc9fDUREE494kvUjNe9729Gz3d4dZiVqDW","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmPQPzUizrJ1JLGoRhciYk9NZKD5hGUag3kcs6Du3xmRPV","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"Dutchmassive - \"Dream Suite\" - Prod. by Sweatson Klank","title":"\"Dream Suite\" - Prod. by Sweatson Klank","version":"catalog-20220222"}}

So I already had some of them on my studio machine and edited them in some way. I could have taken it easy on myself and just finished one of the approaches. Instead, however, I went through each of the Midnight Snacks and made a list of what I like about them. I really like \"infinite\" melodies, similar to Mark's collaboration with Atjazz \"Awake We Stay\". And in Crush Velvet I found exactly this kind of melody that I wanted to work with. I also knew that Crush Velvet is a very personal track for Mark as he dedicated it to his late friend Phil Asher. That's why two things were very important to me: on the one hand, I wanted to pick up on the emotionality and put myself in Mark's situation in a musical way and, on the other hand, I wanted to work as much as possible with the technical means that were up-to-date at the beginning of 2000. That's why I recorded all the sounds with a 12-bit E-MU sampler, arranged the key elements on an Atari and only digitized them for mixing at the very end. This process took some time, but it gives the result a contemporary rawness that I felt was appropriate for my reinterpretation. I'm really happy with the result and the feedback I received during production and afterwards, and makes me curious to see where the journey is taking me.\r\n\r\n-----\r\nThis remix was produced as part of the first Mashibeats remix contest and selected to be minted through community voting.\r\nPrimary collectors will also receive the ltd edition remixes color vinyl EP including this remix - estimated delivery late October 2022.","duration":337.685,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x9d7750ff4cfda1988ab08a7315d30064ab205806/mark-de-clive-lowe-crush-velvet-foursixone-remix--1658945262","image":"ipfs://Qmf1ay4q9txEn4A7puFvFeCBJq5e9cyzkwMJxE5vQU5uMv","losslessAudio":"ipfs://Qme7MXCrWHGHWDq6UW5Hu3YjvwnkupxDa9KBurmXyFzTJv","mimeType":"audio/x-wav","name":"Foursixone - Mark de Clive-Lowe - Crush Velvet (Foursixone Remix)","title":"Mark de Clive-Lowe - Crush Velvet (Foursixone Remix)","version":"catalog-20220222"}}

Please find my statement on the issue below:\r\n\r\nIt's taken me some time to speak up about the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade -- words like \"saddened,\" \"disgusted,\" or \"horrified\" don't begin to cover the ranges of emotions I've felt since reading abortion rights headlines day after day. It's hard for me to gather thoughts on an issue that seems completely illogical. \r\n\r\nWomen have the right to choose what to do with their bodies. Women have the right to decide if and when they want to be mothers. Women's access to basic healthcare is not up for debate. I KNOW that women have the same basic human rights as all people on this planet, regardless of what few individuals in power or larger institutions may try to do to suppress that right. This is a truth that I will continue to live by, and continue to fight for no matter the situation. \r\n\r\nMy performance in Los Angeles last week was one of the more difficult sets I've had in recent memory. Playing music and connecting with people is usually my favorite thing in the world, but I couldn't shake this shadow of awareness that according to many institutions, I don't have the same rights as my male peers on that same stage. And this privilege of getting up in front of audiences to share music that I created is something that very few women have access to. \r\n\r\nA USC study completed in 2020 showed that less than 2% of music producers in the industry are women, and while this number may be shocking to some, it makes perfect sense to me when you consider the centuries of oppression and violence against us that continue to seep into modern politics and healthcare practices. If we want to see more women excel in music (or any field), we must address the underlying issues that keep us from living our lives as equals instead of subordinates. \r\n\r\nToday I'm launching a new series of music NFTs on Catalog titled \"Early Days\" of music I released on Soundcloud from 2012-2018, and I'm donating 50% of all sales from this series to the National Network of Abortion Funds, and to Planned Parenthood. Soundcloud was extremely important to me as a young female producer, and was one of the first community-driven platforms to give me a voice and enable me to share my music with thousands of people before I had any sort of following or cosign. These early releases opened so many doors for me  that I would not have had access to otherwise (like getting discovered and reposted by Soulection, creating Team Supreme with my friends, and giving one of my instrumentals to SZA as an unknown producer), so it feels right to me that a significant portion of profits from that music should be invested in women's rights. \r\n\r\nWith love and compassion,\r\n\r\nDot","duration":204.356,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x92526b99715afeed324fb56ecafcac8056379300/long-distance-1658187137","image":"ipfs://Qmcy5KmzUBJGP9qCyk5JK5SqheWrmt1pkJfMkj9nm3J6DS","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmajyFSVYEWemRQHSahx11YC9WrC1Bsuh5nbLCaPB4naie","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"dot - Long Distance","title":"Long Distance","version":"catalog-20220222"}}

A musical adaptation of a Pleiadian folk song, \"The Cosmic Blink Expands\" offers homage to Maurice Ravel and Bill Evans, spoken from the quietude and vastness of space. Its title illuminates a distinctly Pleiadian perspective: life’s limitless possibilities blossoming from the single blink of a moment we have each been gifted.\r\n\r\n— Making of / Behind the scenes —\r\n\r\nthe first time I performed this song live, the audience reaction was a surprise.\r\n\r\nto tell the story right I'd like to go back to the beginning.\r\n\r\naround christmas in darkness of winter lockdown, I sat in front of a piano to play one note -- causing the following melody to unfold by itself. it was one of those songs nearly fully formed upon arrival, which happens occasionally. but this song felt beamed from the skies, reminiscent of a dream.\r\n\r\nthe time came to choose songs to debut on tour with Alex Wong. I hesitated to pick this at all. its quietness and lack of rhythm made me wonder about its \"show-appropriate\"-ness. but I thought about how it had been written during a songwriting sprint, how out of dozens of songs born that week I kept returning to it again and again. how love letters to Ravel and Evans are bookmarked inside its sheaves. how its power, for me, comes from its resolute tenderness.\r\n\r\nhearing listeners respond with \"I am floating in space\" and \"I want this mood to continue forever\" was deep catharsis. though the music came from mysterious origins, to me these words somehow also said: \"message received\".\r\n\r\nI'm excited to present this song as the first statement of LULLABIES OF THE PLEIADES -- all songs and more about the project will be revealed soon, including lyrics for this one.\r\n\r\nit's an honor to work with Brian Trahan for his expert assistance through the recording and mixing journey, Keith Zarriello for the impulse and guidance to embark on this whole adventure in the first place, Alex Saltz of APS Mastering for his exemplary skills and aesthetic sensibilities. thanks also to Kyle McEvoy of Sonder House, and the team at Falling Sea records for the co-release.\r\n\r\nmuch love and gratitude to Juliette Viger for the visionary artwork <3","duration":127.347,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0xe9b5a2529ad21454cb5e4d172dcb4bc501789463/the-cosmic-blink-expands-1660501998","image":"ipfs://QmSVixxzaRyX8fh1xajmsB5aDTmpyiBSxhb3FRUzXwH73g","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmStGYFkmRQ4cV5rffq9W1NP7CYWJS2Pzs3EJtK1Knpz2x","mimeType":"audio/x-wav","name":"Eric Pan - The Cosmic Blink Expands","project":{"artwork":{"uri":"ipfs://QmSVixxzaRyX8fh1xajmsB5aDTmpyiBSxhb3FRUzXwH73g","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},"title":"Lullabies of the Pleiades","description":"The lullaby is universal to all cultures, within and outside our star system. LULLABIES OF THE PLEIADES collects six solo piano pieces transcribed from indigenous Pleiadian songs, each as sung to a young loved one, local to the far constellation. \r\n\r\nThis exoplanetary musicology project aims to amplify previously undocumented music and its connected folklore, with more research findings to come.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nfield notes excerpt 1. origins\r\n\r\nthe Pleiadians became aware, early on, of their role as beacon and source of wonder. That anyone who saw their bouquet of stars, no matter how distant, would thereafter look to them in search for answers. That they would be listened to—and so what they say should not lead the rest of us astray.\r\n\r\nSwift was their realization that music was the ideal language to communicate wishes, context, and emotion. and so naturally the songs they played for each other carried the same glowing power when broadcast outward, for anyone who didn’t understand their spoken languages.\r\n\r\nThe lullaby is complete.\r\n\r\nA self-contained intention.\r\n\r\n(A gift and a blessing.)\r\n\r\nthe deep care of a lullaby is transmitted across time, across distances so vast that years are needed for light to bridge the gap.\r\n\r\n“I’ll sing to you, so that you might find peace more easily.”\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nfield notes excerpt 2. journey to earth\r\n\r\nAll composition is ethnomusicology, if you’re lucky.\r\n\r\nWhile I cannot vouch for my own luck, and I cannot be certain I have transcribed these Pleiadian lullabies with sufficient accuracy — such that the Pleiadians themselves could still feel their full import — I have tried my best for now. I have sensed that the piano, as an instrument, is unfamiliar to them, but in the end is serviceable for the purposes of transcription.\r\n\r\nGathering the songs began with a process of sitting in stillness, the better by which to detect currents in the air. Then, like sifting particles of sand lifted by wind, I could listen for patterns, the frequencies scattered and embedded in shared consciousness, the imprint of grooves left from countless repetitions of the same gestures of care, given and then continuously passed along. an ancient and timeless wisdom. The endless circulation of blood through the body is an apt metaphor for the rejuvenating effect of songs repeated and echoed across time.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nfield notes excerpt 3. the increase\r\n\r\nI am hard-pressed to identify when, exactly, this collection of songs changed me. I had felt that the transmission was complete, at least for the time being. As I played and re-played them for myself, familiarizing my ears and listening for what messages they spoke, I came to realize that each lullaby held ever deeper secrets that I felt unable to plumb.\r\n\r\n…a different day, performing a different one, with a different disposition, might reveal a new facet of a song, the way an answer might glimmer from the depths of a gemstone with light shone upon it, precisely angled — though in the case of this music, perhaps not to be found again.\r\n\r\nThe whole of each lullaby was beyond my comprehension, and my efforts to document or understand their meaning seemed thwarted at every renewed attempt, as if to be told: “What you seek cannot be found here.”\r\n\r\n+\r\ngradually I came to realize that my exploration of this music would change dramatically between renditions, especially contrasting playing alone against playing for others.\r\n+ it might not be the lullabies themselves which hold power but the act of giving them.\r\n\r\nit is now clear to me … the stability and longevity of these lullabies depends upon passing them on. They have arrived at our present place and time due to each sharing that came before, from one caretaker to a loved one, a gifting of heart and time cupped with both hands.\r\n\r\nThis awareness has brought me to an imperative — that I let go of the Lullabies of the Pleiades, as well as the need to keep them close to me, for intimate study, as if I’d isolated them to petri dishes. It is better that I give them out, and not reservedly, but with clarion gusto. (this step also makes it possible for anyone else to take these songs of care, understand and even transform them in their own way: sing them to another, releasing them into freedom again, increasing their potency with each gifting."},"title":"The Cosmic Blink Expands","trackNumber":1,"version":"catalog-20220222"}}

Falling in love with someone with every bone in you is such a heavy feeling in your soul. When the relationship ends not because of betrayal, not because of lack of trust, not even because of lack of love. Sometimes relationships end due to lack of communication. When a relationship ends this way, it's hard to let go, it's hard to move on.\r\n\r\nAt least for one person in the relationship that is. \r\n\r\nI found out in 2021 that the one i loved deeply, who i was so kind to, so helpful, so generous to after the breakup...they had moved on. Quickly. 9 days later quickly. 2 years of a love so deep one can't believe that it could have meant nothing at all. How can someone who made you feel what real love is, move on so so so quickly? My heart had officially shattered.\r\n\r\nI tossed & turned with this questions for months. At the end of the day, it roots to so many answers. Psychologically, emotionally, egotistical. The list goes on. \r\n\r\nBut somewhere in the world lies a quote about seeing people for who they really are. As humans we tend to see what we want to see.

So, to find my way on to Catalog and my first vinyl through the Mashi Beats Remix Competition was yet another piece of the puzzle that was a perfect fit. \r\n\r\nIt's rare that you get multiple songs to play with for a remix, so working on the Mashi Beats remix competition was exciting for me. Whenever I do a remix I always try a few ideas as I feel it's the only way to know which one is the right one, and it took me a while to find my feet. I was determined to find something that felt like me, but kept the essence of the original too… I think I tried 4 different songs! In the end, as is often the case, the first idea I started was the one that made me feel the most excited. There were so many musical parts to chop up and build from it was like working with a great sample pack. I always aim to approach remixes the same way I make music, and I started by building some atmospheres and loops that carry enough emotion to pull me into the flow state. In the end I have to be able to get lost in a remix for it to feel right.. and for me this could fit easily on one of my own releases as well as on one of Mark’s.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis remix was produced as part of the first Mashi Beats remix contest and selected to be minted through community voting.

Falling in love with someone with every bone in you is such a heavy feeling in your soul. When the relationship ends not because of betrayal, not because of lack of trust, not even because of lack of love. Sometimes relationships end due to lack of communication. When a relationship ends this way, it's hard to let go, it's hard to move on.\r\n\r\nAt least for one person in the relationship that is. \r\n\r\nI found out in 2021 that the one i loved deeply, who i was so kind to, so helpful, so generous to after the breakup...they had moved on. Quickly. 9 days later quickly. 2 years of a love so deep one can't believe that it could have meant nothing at all. How can someone who made you feel what real love is, move on so so so quickly? My heart had officially shattered.\r\n\r\nI tossed & turned with this questions for months. At the end of the day, it roots to so many answers. Psychologically, emotionally, egotistical. The list goes on. \r\n\r\nBut somewhere in the world lies a quote about seeing people for who they really are. As humans we tend to see what we want to see. We refuse to see beyond what our heart sees. Love is blind, right?\r\n\r\n\"Fake\" is about being aware of how we see people vs. how they really are. Our soul always deserves to be loved truly & not diminished. We deserve to be loved with the same passion we love.","duration":187.344,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x17745542d194af33d235e39f00bc27736ccc1f2c/fake-1661376563","image":"ipfs://Qme1tzbvUswQ8qqL15CDx7HX4Ji84AJKqk4qVawrPVvt8Z","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmctAKpvdEHUDoWtDt2s6h6nY7DyeEnsQs57Arz341pdG8","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"SUBCIETY - fake","title":"fake","version":"catalog-20220222"}}

And two, he was from Columbus and, at the time, did not hear many with his sound. \r\n\r\nAround the spring of 2015, quite a few of us would chill and be creative over a mutual friend's crib. I was always connected with KMB cause he would sit quietly in a corner and just work, not paying much attention to all the noise that was going around him. We became friends, and this was the first song he produced of mine. At the time, I was still working a shitty warehouse job and trying to balance the 9-5 and artist life. I wanted to make something motivational and relatable because the reality is most of us had to/currently work a job while pursuing our passions.","duration":232.224,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0xf873e05c28be2845f09c828dae42084b6b1c060e/afterhourz-anthem-1660166941","image":"ipfs://QmSjHXKvatnzFJtm4E7Xn1dWFczJ39Y6H8gr2TcMN9jKSh","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmV7koyeaPPkjTBtjG31Emuz2ficN4Y9UFnoHzTyhpxhbB","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"Dom Deshawn - AfterhOurz Anthem","title":"AfterhOurz Anthem","version":"catalog-20220222"}}

So I quickly reached out and let him know that I'm boarding a flight but will home in a few hours but will be cutting it super close and asked If I could submit the following the day. He said \"Midnight sharp, no exceptions\" So I landed at Tampa International, my friend picked me up and I told him we need to stop at Best Buy or somewhere I can purchase speakers since mine were stuck in storage back in Los Angeles at the time. Ran into Best Buy and they didn't have any decent monitors in stock so I purchased a little blue tooth JBL flip speaker. We got to his townhouse and I scrambled to download the sample with less than 2 hours until deadline. Opened up Ableton Live, Laid some basic drums down and went to work manipulating and micro-chopping the sample. Made something quickly and decided, it needed some dope change ups and some extra layering. Did my very best, mixing as I went along and exported right at the buzzer. Turned out to be one of my favorite tracks I've made due to the changes ups so I'm glad I went back to put in more time. I uploaded my track to Soundcloud 6 minutes after the deadline passed. He was definitely not joking when he told me \"Midnight sharp, no exceptions\" because he did not accept my entry haha. I didn't get discouraged, I ended up submitting to Flip Sessions 3, 4 & 6. I created an entry for 5, but didn't end up submitting it. I intended to use this track on my (at the time) upcoming album \"The Uproot\" but last minute pulled it to place on \"Chill Gawd, Chill\" to end out the tape and take us to the next chapter, and thus..... \"OneForShoes\" was born. \r\n\r\n\"Chill Gawd, Chill\" was released initially February 5th 2015 Digitally on Bandcamp and as A 120minute (2 hour) Cassette, that came with Nag Champa. It sold out immediately and was Bandcamp's best selling Cassette. Due to high demand and fomo, I was pressured into doing a second pressing of Cassette w/ Nag Champa which dropped on my birthday, May 23rd 2016. Once again, it sold out immediately and was Bandcamp's best selling cassette for 2 weeks in a row. Obviously, my most popular / successful instrumental album as Dutchyyy (fka Dutchy) the demand to upload this to streaming was unbearable. To this Day, \"Chill Gawd, Chill\" remains only available on bandcamp. In fall of 2020, I did one final pressing of the two hour tape w/ Nag Champa. It was the last time I will press \"this version\" of the cassette. The problem was, I pulled 4 songs from what was supposed to be my follow up album \"The Uproot\" and placed them on \"Chill Gawd, Chill\" last minute. Those songs were \"OneForshoes\" / \"Evolution of a Shrug\" / \"The Scramble\" / \"Lamb's Bread\" (feat. ashtrejinkins & sleepyeyes) and removed a few songs that were created specifically for \"Chill Gawd, Chill\".  This decision derailed the release of \"The Uproot\" which it still remains officially unreleased to this day.  Instead I released \"Traversal\" next, which is actually the follow up album to the \"The Uproot\". \r\n\r\n(confusing huh?)\r\n\r\n *****All bidders on this auction will receive a link to my master cloud based vault \"Dutchyyy vs the Algorithms\" over 110gb's of nearly my full released and unreleased discography. *****","duration":118.805,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x26ef03a20aaeda8aafcee4e146dc6b328195947c/oneforshoes-1660008841","image":"ipfs://QmYp5Tmj4fViL9muufYEkYE8Hitt3KwwqGdV6uaRBjbwnK","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmaSv8wn2tcrwh1X2zR21Jp7RkwXuzjp6j7URAGV4NXsCs","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"Dutchyyy - OneForShoes","project":{"artwork":{"uri":"ipfs://QmYp5Tmj4fViL9muufYEkYE8Hitt3KwwqGdV6uaRBjbwnK","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},"title":"\"Chill Gawd, Chill\"","description":"\"OneForShoes\" - Produced by Dutchyyy\r\n\r\nhttps://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/chill-gawd-chill\r\n\r\n\"Chill Gawd, Chill\" was released initially February 5th 2015 Digitally on Bandcamp and as A 120minute (2 hour) Cassette, that came with Nag Champa.

At the time, I was out of town on A contract, teaching  at the hospital but I listened on my break and sent her back a message on IG. Letting her know I loved what I heard and added my critiques on the mixing.  She recorded over two  beats that were already officially released on my album/cassette, so I didn't put too much thought into it.  A few months later in March 2017  I asked if she minded if I posted one of the songs on my Soundcloud on her birthday (which is the demo version of Adult and varies from the version on the official \"Dutchess EP\"\r\n\r\nhttps://soundcloud.com/dutchmassive/mousey-mcglynn-adult-prod-by-dutchy-niceguy-x-vinny\r\n\r\nMsMMMcG did a lot of live performances so I told her that she can record vocals over any song of mine that inspires her.  Months passed and she said she wanted to record enough tracks for an EP. I said that's fine, as long as I can mix the vocals to my beats. She ended up choosing more beats from albums that have already been released, so I said I'm cool with the EP being a free promo thing because I personally didn't want to monetize tracks that I've already released and made money from. More time passed, she would send vocals as she recorded them but I was in the process of working on two new albums and a side project when I was home, and I was out of state traveling teaching at hospitals every other month, So admittedly, I was super busy and I procrastinated on mixing the tracks, until she lit a fire under me letting me know she wanted to shoot multiple videos for the songs.   Sent out a few different versions, more time passed, and I finally agreed to her releasing the EP on Bandcamp & Streaming.  She was insistent on splitting any profits 50/50 but I declined and told her not to worry about splits because I still felt weird about double monetizing my beats. (I know, I know... I'm not the most business savvy artist on the planet)\r\n\r\nIn April of 2019 she released the \"Dutchess EP\" on bandcamp & Streaming\r\n\r\nDUTCHESS EP LINK: https://msmmmcg.bandcamp.com/album/dutchess-ep\r\n\r\nAlso releasing 3 videos from the EP throughout 2019\r\n\r\nThe more you know:\r\n\r\nThe Instrumental used for this song is from the 2015 (Digital Version) album \"Traversal\" and it's originally titled \"The Chop & The Loop\".\r\n\r\nhttps://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/track/the-chop-the-loop","duration":225.123,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x26ef03a20aaeda8aafcee4e146dc6b328195947c/-the-stakes-f-msmmmcg--1661797600","image":"ipfs://Qmb5kn2z5KXS23qNDpsQmF6T5nS1FjRyQS9vMHSSkeKb12","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmR6f9KEurYdZHmSPuthBKjWdCxzvwHr3UgtPraDhg1MEY","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"Dutchyyy - \"the stakes\" (f/  MsMMMcG)","project":{"artwork":{"uri":"ipfs://Qmb5kn2z5KXS23qNDpsQmF6T5nS1FjRyQS9vMHSSkeKb12","mimeType":"image/png"},"title":"Dutchess EP","description":"Album Produced by: Dutchyyy\r\nVocals Written & Performed by: MsMMMcG (aka Margaret \"Mousey\" McGlynn) \r\n\r\n+ https://www.msmmmcg.com/\r\n+ https://msmmmcg.bandcamp.com/album/dutchess-ep"},"title":"\"the stakes\" (f/  MsMMMcG)","trackNumber":4,"version":"catalog-20220222"}}

If auction ends at .5 eth or above, winner will be added to the royalty splits on DISTROKID in perpetuity for a 20% split and the 2nd highest bidder will receive a 10% split (If there is only one person bidding, they will receive the full 30% royalty split on the single)\r\n\r\n3.)

If you're not already using DistroKid, you'll get a 50% discount to sign up!  I will need the email address that you already use or would like to use for DistroKid for this to work. Until you accept my invitation, your assigned split of the earnings will be held in DistroKid's bank. Once you accept and create an account, the held earnings will be available in your own Bank within 24 hours. Bank access is permanent so if you decide not to renew your DistroKid membership you will still be able to keep earning royalties and withdraw it.  If you aren't familiar with how streaming payouts work on DistroKid or how long it takes for reported earnings to hit after music is first uploaded. Feel free to visit DistroKid & look through the FAQ's\r\n\r\nWhile it's my hope that you collect my music with the intent of holding onto it forever. In the name of Utility, If you would like to use these Streaming Royalties as an incentive to sell to another collector for any reason I can either transfer your full split to the person who collects it from you, or I can add them in at any time for whatever percentage you and that person agree on based on your percentage of the splits (mine will remain the same) This of course requires a bit of trust & communication.  So feel free to reach out to me Privately on twitter @dutchmassive. \r\n\r\n* I'm also willing to add this feature on other uncollected songs of mine on Catalog so feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss further.\r\n\r\n*also because of this unique added utility, I set the the creator share to 15% for this release instead of my usual 10%*\r\n\r\nThis is my attempt at saying thank you & bringing more value and building lasting bonds with my collectors.  I've rejected the streaming model for years and have so much music I could have uploaded and decided not to, I'd like to change how I approach streaming and start uploading more music instead of exclusively posting to bandcamp or hoarding it away in the \"Dutchyyy VS the Algorithms\" cloud drive.  We will see how this goes,  maybe it will become the start of exciting future and you will be the catalyst. =)","duration":174.602,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x26ef03a20aaeda8aafcee4e146dc6b328195947c/jawn-adelphia-1660562772","image":"ipfs://QmYbmHimiykWLaXiFCdjJDpgx1VTd8gkUaj4no1cKWkE9U","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmWg2uxXeVSLvKfFNErMaYXnBb1gJoUYqsK77JoDhAMmXe","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"Dutchyyy - Jawn'adelphia","project":{"artwork":{"uri":"ipfs://QmYbmHimiykWLaXiFCdjJDpgx1VTd8gkUaj4no1cKWkE9U","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},"title":"\"Jawn'adelphia\" (Evolving Portals)","description":"\"Jawn'adelphia\" (Evolving Portals)\r\n\r\nProduced / Composed by Dutchyyy\r\n\r\nBackstory / Details available at: \r\n\r\nhttps://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/portals-jawnadelphia\r\n\r\nreleased December 25, 2021"},"title":"Jawn'adelphia","trackNumber":4,"version":"catalog-20220222"}}

I'll be taking 0% creator share on this one. \r\n\r\nBackstory:\r\nNot much of a backstory here,  back in 2017 when twitter was plagued by the same 20 rotating music production Hot-takes, the age old question of which takes more skill, Sampling or playing instruments was trending.  The days of being able to just focus on art,  then post said art to social media with a link is gone.  You must engage or perish haha, so I respectfully engaged.  As a producer that does both,  I prefer to sample.  Not just loop up samples (tho I also enjoy loops and there is nothing wrong with loops),  but I like to mangle samples into new worlds so they are no longer recognizable or able to be detected by any form of \"content I.d.\". Turning Samples into instruments through a billion micro chops is my favorite pass time and anyone paying attention without a doubt knows this.  However,  I've been making non-sample based music for over 2 decades as well.  Someone on twitter responding to my neutral attempt to squash this age old argument so we can focus on more important things said \"What would you know, all you do is sample anyway\".  When I told them,  I do everything under the sun, skill and level of difficulty like music in general is all subjective. What feels impossible to some is a simple as breathing air to others and vice versa. All that matters is creating art you enjoy creating.  They then challenged to me to make a \"Chill-hop type beat\" in an hour.  30 minutes later A track I never intended to release was born \"Tingles\".  I've been watching Asmr since 2015 to relax,  so I hopefully the track title makes a little more sense.  \r\n\r\nMay you find peace during turbulent times.   \r\n\r\nPeacePeace. \r\n\r\n\r\n**** Whoever ends up collecting this will receive a link to my master cloud based vault \"Dutchyyy vs the Algorithms\" over 110gb's of nearly my full released and unreleased discography.  *****","duration":222.067,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x26ef03a20aaeda8aafcee4e146dc6b328195947c/tingles-1655114647","image":"ipfs://QmYkPrBpUPqG8s6hNvtjEjDvVmYB11vMjK9MbTiCNf5TiY","losslessAudio":"ipfs://Qmef3TfM5Pd8sMH15eH7PepFGPb2Dpm6RCwYPmsHhrz5Zw","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"Dutchyyy - Tingles","title":"Tingles","version":"catalog-20220222"}}

Examples: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7y7ezlysH53CCHbRt72PdS \r\n\r\n  He also appeared on my sophomore  \"Dutchmassive\" album titled \"Crush Your System\" released late 2007 on Rawkus Records (Song originally recorded in 2004 for his  unreleased album titled \"Godspeed\") \r\n\r\nhttps://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/track/life-lines-f-surreal-produced-jeremy-ian-thomas\r\n\r\n   Jeremy was visiting from Los Angeles at the time, so it was dope to run into him by chance and catch up since even back then,  It was rare to see me out in public at events.  We ended up in a conversation about the current state of music, where for the previous few years, a lot of \"Beat Scene\" producers were pivoting to making more dance / industry friendly music that no longer sounded like the music they were known for.  I think the convo was sparked based on me uploading \"Where are we headed?\" to soundcloud, which was my sonic response to this topic the year prior. ( you can read that backstory here: https://beta.catalog.works/dutchyyy/where-are-we-headed- )\r\n  At the time Jeremy was heavily inspired by Kanye's Auto-tune Arc and actually preferred the more industry friendly direction a lot of people were going, which at the time blew my mind and caught me off guard. Don't get me wrong,  I enjoy pop, dance, and more commercial sounding music as well, but I was definitely sad to see so many of my favorite producers changing their entire sonic identity to try and ride the  current wave that had gained so much momentum at the time.  He spoke about the science of Major Chords and how they resonate more with the general public. People that just turn on FM radio and don't really go out their way to dig for music they love. A topic I was very familiar with at the time. Since I had recently watched a video about the same few Major chords, scales being used in the majority of the top100 pop radio hits for a few decades running.  We both had to leave the venue pretty early on in the night, so we cut the convo short, agreed to disagree,  hugged,  said peace and I ended up bouncing shortly after.   \r\n   As soon as I got home,  I loaded up Ableton with the aim of making a Anti-Pop, Radio friendly track haha.  A defiant response to the sentiment that you had to use happy Pop chords to appeal to the general public.   I went in multiple directions pretty rapidly,  I didn't want to create a trap song but I still wanted to keep the track up-tempo.  I love House music and have released a few house tracks over the years since 2006 so I didn't want to go in that direction and keep things out of my comfort zone.  Ironically starting with the same sample I used for \"The Turning Point\" then switching gears multiple times and touching on multiple emotions that could be seen as \"uncomfortable\" by \"The General Public\" before ending the song by re-playing the \"Buck Town\" sample on my synths. Exported the track,  made simple artwork, and immediately uploaded it Soundcloud before midnight.  \r\n\r\n https://soundcloud.com/dutchmassive/dutchy-no-pop-chords\r\n\r\nWhen I moved back out to Los Angeles later that year,  We ended up grabbing dinner with some friends and he laughed and said he knew my song was direct response to our conversation at \"Ol' dirty Sundays\" If that conversation didn't happen, this song wouldn't exist so I'm glad I decided to leave the house that night instead of staying in.\r\n\r\nIn 2020,  I decided to begin releasing a series of unreleased songs and tracks created between albums or that I couldn't fit on albums titled \"Beat Hoarder\".  The Intention was to release a new volume every few months to all streaming services since I have so much unreleased music that doesn't belong on any album.  I ended up releasing Vol. 1 on bandcamp along with the pre-order for \"The Uproot\" on cassette. \r\n\r\nhttps://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/beat-hoarder-vol-1\r\n\r\nA few days later, I got an eviction letter from my landlord. After a year of battling the leasing company and going thru a failed black mold remediation they had me living in for 2 years. The moment the \"eviction memorandum\" was lifted in Florida.  They used the pandemic to kick me out instead of properly getting rid of the mold and just rent to new unsuspecting tenants.  This was super stressful on-top of already super stressful times so all my plans for this series and \"The Uproot\" cassette got derailed.  A week prior to the eviction letter, My uncle had been trying to get me to move in with my 93 year old grandmother who lived alone and needed someone to take care of her, especially during the height of the pandemic, but I didn't want to leave my house and all my plants and lose the ability to create music 24/7 as loud as possible without worrying about bother neighbors. So the eviction was glass half full at least and had a positive outcome.  So I packed up my 2 bedroom, 2bath House,  placed almost everything in storage and moved into this tiny 10x12 room in a retirement community and focused on live streaming, video editing and real time, long form live sessions #EvolvingPortals where everything is raw and in the moment since I lost the ability to play music loud in speakers to properly mix outside of headphones. Long story short, I basically got distracted forgot about my plans to release the Beat Hoarder series in general.   Maybe I'll resume that now.  \r\nIf / when this record is collected.   I'll submit Vol. 1 to my DSP / distributor and make it available on all streaming services a month out from when this record is collected =)\r\n\r\n**** Whoever ends up collecting this will receive a link to my master cloud based vault \"Dutchyyy vs the Algorithms\" over 110gb's of nearly my full released and unreleased discography.  *****","duration":262.165,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x26ef03a20aaeda8aafcee4e146dc6b328195947c/no-pop-chords-1656910251","image":"ipfs://QmPXaZcWf5qmbaCntgXbXNAypqKWq3fk53mdYSrawLY9ng","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmS5sPhxsoPLp3xy8c6DqrfccC6VbbhAF2bA3ygyioYX16","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"Dutchyyy - No Pop Chords","project":{"artwork":{"uri":"ipfs://QmPXaZcWf5qmbaCntgXbXNAypqKWq3fk53mdYSrawLY9ng","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},"title":"BEAT HOARDER VOL. 1","description":"Track 5 - \"NO POP CHORDS\" - produced by Dutchyyy\r\n\r\nBEAT HOARDER VOL. 1 \r\n(A collection of outtakes and unreleased tracks that didn't make it on \"Chill Gawd, Chill\", \"Traversal\" or \"The Uproot\" (Circa 2012-2017)\r\n\r\nhttps://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/beat-hoarder-vol-1"},"title":"No Pop Chords","trackNumber":5,"version":"catalog-20220222"}}

LULLABIES OF THE PLEIADES collects six solo piano pieces transcribed from indigenous Pleiadian songs, each as sung to a young loved one, local to the far constellation. \r\n\r\nThis exoplanetary musicology project aims to amplify previously undocumented music and its connected folklore, with more research findings to come.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nfield notes excerpt 1. origins\r\n\r\nthe Pleiadians became aware, early on, of their role as beacon and source of wonder. That anyone who saw their bouquet of stars, no matter how distant, would thereafter look to them in search for answers. That they would be listened to—and so what they say should not lead the rest of us astray.\r\n\r\nSwift was their realization that music was the ideal language to communicate wishes, context, and emotion. and so naturally the songs they played for each other carried the same glowing power when broadcast outward, for anyone who didn’t understand their spoken languages.\r\n\r\nThe lullaby is complete.\r\n\r\nA self-contained intention.\r\n\r\n(A gift and a blessing.)\r\n\r\nthe deep care of a lullaby is transmitted across time, across distances so vast that years are needed for light to bridge the gap.\r\n\r\n“I’ll sing to you, so that you might find peace more easily.”\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nfield notes excerpt 2. journey to earth\r\n\r\nAll composition is ethnomusicology, if you’re lucky.\r\n\r\nWhile I cannot vouch for my own luck, and I cannot be certain I have transcribed these Pleiadian lullabies with sufficient accuracy — such that the Pleiadians themselves could still feel their full import — I have tried my best for now. I have sensed that the piano, as an instrument, is unfamiliar to them, but in the end is serviceable for the purposes of transcription.\r\n\r\nGathering the songs began with a process of sitting in stillness, the better by which to detect currents in the air. Then, like sifting particles of sand lifted by wind, I could listen for patterns, the frequencies scattered and embedded in shared consciousness, the imprint of grooves left from countless repetitions of the same gestures of care, given and then continuously passed along. an ancient and timeless wisdom. The endless circulation of blood through the body is an apt metaphor for the rejuvenating effect of songs repeated and echoed across time.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nfield notes excerpt 3. the increase\r\n\r\nI am hard-pressed to identify when, exactly, this collection of songs changed me. I had felt that the transmission was complete, at least for the time being. As I played and re-played them for myself, familiarizing my ears and listening for what messages they spoke, I came to realize that each lullaby held ever deeper secrets that I felt unable to plumb.\r\n\r\n…a different day, performing a different one, with a different disposition, might reveal a new facet of a song, the way an answer might glimmer from the depths of a gemstone with light shone upon it, precisely angled — though in the case of this music, perhaps not to be found again.\r\n\r\nThe whole of each lullaby was beyond my comprehension, and my efforts to document or understand their meaning seemed thwarted at every renewed attempt, as if to be told: “What you seek cannot be found here.”\r\n\r\n+\r\ngradually I came to realize that my exploration of this music would change dramatically between renditions, especially contrasting playing alone against playing for others.\r\n+ it might not be the lullabies themselves which hold power but the act of giving them.\r\n\r\nit is now clear to me … the stability and longevity of these lullabies depends upon passing them on. They have arrived at our present place and time due to each sharing that came before, from one caretaker to a loved one, a gifting of heart and time cupped with both hands.\r\n\r\nThis awareness has brought me to an imperative — that I let go of the Lullabies of the Pleiades, as well as the need to keep them close to me, for intimate study, as if I’d isolated them to petri dishes. It is better that I give them out, and not reservedly, but with clarion gusto.

But Why? \r\nThis was very first long form Portal I captured on my SP404, but to understand the significance of this recording. Let me start from the beginning.\r\n\r\nWhat are these Portals?\r\n\r\nPortals are live recorded sessions, capturing the entire process of making music in real time. Nothing is Finalized, all mistakes have a purpose, all fumbles build to evolving ideas. The Patient Ear is rewarded. \r\n\r\nHow did we get here?\r\n\r\nI've created multiple albums worth of songs from 2017-Present. Yet I haven't released an official  album since I dropped \"Traversal\" on Cassette shortly after my mother passed late 2016 while I was living in Los Angles. After a lifetime of living in apartments, getting evicted nearly each time for noise complaints, after couch surfing while traveling and Traversing across the country bouncing from Los Angeles to New York non stop. I moved back to Tampa and finally rented my first house in April of 2017.\r\n\r\nNo more noise complaints, No Relationships to distract me. No room mates or family.  Just solo and super isolated alone in a 2 bedroom house a half a mile away from the ocean (Gulf of Mexico). Living alone, So close to nature in walking distance with no one around that I could bother or that would question what or how long I was creating. (if you ever lived with a producer, you probably understand the pain of listening to us audition 600 snares in a row before finally choosing one, and that's just choose one drum haha) I was able to experiment and create endlessly. I'd black out for 16 hrs at time with extreme creative tunnel vision and come to, realizing I was on my 40th version of flipping the same sample. I would have so many different variations I liked,  I could never choose or settle on which version I would choose to make a final beat.\r\n\r\nThere was something about finality that I wanted to defy with every fiber in my being.  I just couldn't find the desire to complete or polish tracks. I put so so so much love into my official albums. A lot of emotion, time & energy go into making long elaborate journeys that flow like a story. So in an age where albums maybe have about 10 to 12 one minute tracks, and algorithms that make it near impossible to reach the fans we've spent all these years building up. I found myself needing to slowdown and re-evaluate how to navigate in this brave new music industry. I put a pause on releasing new albums. However I never stopped creating. Truth is, I've made more music from 2017 to present,  then I made from 1995-2016 combined.  All while having the most fun  i've ever had experimenting while no one was focused on me.  So many long sessions of inspiration and I wasn't capturing any of it.  I began thinking about music in a different way.  Thinking about our favorite albums.  The collection of songs that only last a few minutes each.  Knowing that to get to those refined final versions.  Hours or days of creating went into shaping them into the tracks we end up with.  I thought about albums like Miles Davis \"Bitches Brew\" and Arthur Verocai's 1972 self titled album and thought to myself,  how crazy would it be if we had access to the entire creative process for those albums, or any of your favorite artists albums.  The jam sessions and sketches before they turned into the truncated and finalized versions we ended up with.. Magic tends to happen during the experimental phase of music production,  a lot of which is never heard on refined and released songs. Think about it like this,  you ever noticed how people do their best work when the pressure of being recorded isn't there.  Ever did something so inspired and just couldn't replicate it once you remembered to press record.  I became obsessed with wanted to document those possible moments of magic, mistakes and all but unfortunately,  I wasn't able to pull this off in Ableton alone,  Id capture long takes,  but the moment I pressed the stop button,  it would stop the recording (resample) which led to hundreds of recorded files and killed my hard drive space very quickly.    I needed an external source to capture everything I was doing on my computer.  So I decided to stream on twitch.   I would stream my sessions for hours, and forget I was streaming, completely neglecting chat because I so tunnel in the creative zone.  I would start to read back the chat after I ended the stream and realized people where trying to interact and ask me questions and felt neglected.   I felt bad because I wasn't purposely ignoring anyone,  I just have severe ADHD and I get lost in the creative process, constantly moving from idea to idea which is why I wanted to begin capturing the entire process in the first place so I could try and understand how I work while in this meditative state.   People started making a big deal about me not interacting with chat when I was live so I had to disclaimer my streams with intent and label them as a Portal opening inside my home that allows you to just see and hear what I'm doing but I'm lost in the portal and can't see you.    This went over well and people would sit and watch me for hours at time just to see where I was going to take things.   The twitch culture was changing and I started to notice more and more new people come in and lose interest when I didn't answer their questions.   So on January 4th 2019.  I promoted my first live stream in which I would be periodically  popping out of my creative zone to make sure I could interact with chat.   I began the stream in the morning playing ambient, improv keys and practiced looking at chat,  I then began to go thru some sessions,  allowing chat to look thru the file names and choose which session I would open.  It was dope, like I was hanging out with people in my house, but I'm still me, so I'd go long periods where I'd get lost in a project and forget about chat haha.  As someone who loves a challenge,  I decided to let chat send me samples to flip.   The stream ended up being 10 hours,  and because I was unable to hyper focus in my zone and felt the pressure of knowing chat was watching and craving interaction,  I had this voice in the back of head to constantly keep changing up the sample.  Which worked out because it forever altered how I approach sessions.    \r\n\r\nYou can watch the entire 10 hour live stream here for Free.\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1o8T4qm6kHwuos6h_3cLbkYgX8QvDBXkb/view?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nThis session would end up fundamentally changing how I approach music and ended up becoming the first #EvolvingPortal  A project file I would revisit over and over for the next 3 years.  Constantly resampling what I did the previous session and evolving it into something new.  I perfected this method by 2020 and went absolutely bonkers evolving multiple portals until I eventually forgot how to create a normal, short song haha.  \r\n\r\nBut it all began with this Project file titled:\r\n\r\n\"I should have saved this hours ago\" or \"ishstha\" for short.\r\n\r\nhttps://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/portals-i-should-have-saved-this-hours-ago\r\n\r\nThis isn't every session for this project file.   If you inspect the Artwork, you will see how many different versions exist.  I still have never exported the initial version I began creating in that 10hr live stream,  but the version on bandcamp has the 2 most recent Portals I recorded in 2021 plus the video attached in the bandcamp link is a truncated snippet version of the newest most evolved version in which I did all the visuals for as well. Plus, one other portal which brings us back to this 1 of 1 you are reading about now and why it's so important to me.\r\n\r\nCapturing my sessions on twitch was nice.  But converting twitch streams to audio files would result in super degraded audio quality. So I first attempted to capture my audio coming out of my audio interface and into my portable Tascam-DR05 but all the recordings would come out thin and didn't sound anything like they did in Ableton.   I sold my OG SP404 a few years prior,  but remembered I could resample for an extended amount of time when I had it even though I never used it in that manner.  So I copped a SP404SX from the homie, even though I wanted the OG404 again,  I wanted to test this method out as quick as possible so I payed to have SX shipped overnight and went to make sure I bought any cable I would need to execute pulling this simple task off.   The SP arrived the following evening after the sun went down. I opened up the project file \"I should have saved this hours ago\" created a new version, added a few new samples into the project for some new creative energy.   Hooked up the SP404,  Pressed Record and thus was born the first, long form, in the moment live captured Portal as one long file.   \r\n\r\nASMR.WAV\r\n\r\nI've gotten way more advanced in my methods evolving portals since, While this may not be my favorite Portal.  It is the most pivotal and special one since it was the first time, I realized I would be able to pull of my vision.\r\n\r\nSince then, I've recorded thousands of hours worth of Portals.  32 minutes is now a short \"song\" to me.   Most ranging from 1hr to a few hours each.  Due to live, real time nature of Portals,  if you don't have patience or faith in where I'm going take things,  I recommend approaching long Portals like you would putting on a new record you found to dig for samples, and maybe skip around at first,  because most portals are albums inside albums with the dopest music I've ever made tucked in between the weirdest experimental pockets.  In a world obsessed with short form content,  Portals have no chance of surviving in terms of marketing or monetary value.   All streaming services like Spotify pay fractions of a penny per stream.   I can't imagine a 3 hour opus getting millions of unskipped plays.   I had to have bandcamp, specifically and manually increase the size of my uploads because the wavs were so large, I couldn't even fit a fraction of a portal, which brings me to the other difficulty.  Attempting to separate and/or name hours of improv recording that changes so often while also revisiting the early parts for new passes to evolve the ideas in different ways.   Because of these issues and file size limits,  Most portals remain unreleased with a few exceptions that exist on bandcamp,  even more for bandcamp subscribers and even more exist on \"Dutchyyy VS the algorithms\" master vault cloud drive and because that drive holds most of released discography also,  I have to be selective with what I upload to not max out the 200gb limit which I'm quickly approaching with 142 of 200gb used.\r\n\r\nSo for this Auction,  I'm going to do something different.   \r\n\r\n*****Anyone who bids on this auction will receive a link to my master cloud based vault \"Dutchyyy vs the Algorithms\" of nearly my full released and unreleased discography.  *****\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n*****Winner of the auction will get a 1TB Samsung SSD portable drive that not only holds everything on the cloud drive,  but all the Portals unreleased in super long raw form directly from their master folders strait from the SP404SX and All the long videos and twitch streams that are too large to upload anywhere*****","duration":1920.052,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x26ef03a20aaeda8aafcee4e146dc6b328195947c/asmr-wav-evolving-portals--1656926509","image":"ipfs://QmRafs6UTjuT1ihKG3QiPWvQPdUzzh4m1inB1pDCn4sKUn","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmWh3FKEvrRJdUZjCUrVCpfWaxsDCVcBpSrnVNi57WjrCs","mimeType":"audio/flac","name":"Dutchyyy - ASMR.WAV (Evolving Portals)","title":"ASMR.WAV (Evolving Portals)","version":"catalog-20220222"}}

Included in the primary auction is a custom merchandise package and two tickets to any Dot show (festivals excluded). \r\n\r\n50% of profits from the \"Early Days\" series will also be donated to the National Network of Abortion Funds, and to Planned Parenthood. Please find my statement on the issue below:\r\n\r\nIt's taken me some time to speak up about the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade -- words like \"saddened,\" \"disgusted,\" or \"horrified\" don't begin to cover the ranges of emotions I've felt since reading abortion rights headlines day after day. It's hard for me to gather thoughts on an issue that seems completely illogical. \r\n\r\nWomen have the right to choose what to do with their bodies. Women have the right to decide if and when they want to be mothers. Women's access to basic healthcare is not up for debate. I KNOW that women have the same basic human rights as all people on this planet, regardless of what few individuals in power or larger institutions may try to do to suppress that right. This is a truth that I will continue to live by, and continue to fight for no matter the situation. \r\n\r\nMy performance in Los Angeles last week was one of the more difficult sets I've had in recent memory. Playing music and connecting with people is usually my favorite thing in the world, but I couldn't shake this shadow of awareness that according to many institutions, I don't have the same rights as my male peers on that same stage. And this privilege of getting up in front of audiences to share music that I created is something that very few women have access to. \r\n\r\nA USC study completed in 2020 showed that less than 2% of music producers in the industry are women, and while this number may be shocking to some, it makes perfect sense to me when you consider the centuries of oppression and violence against us that continue to seep into modern politics and healthcare practices. If we want to see more women excel in music (or any field), we must address the underlying issues that keep us from living our lives as equals instead of subordinates. \r\n\r\nToday I'm launching a new series of music NFTs on Catalog titled \"Early Days\" of music I released on Soundcloud from 2012-2018, and I'm donating 50% of all sales from this series to the National Network of Abortion Funds, and to Planned Parenthood. Soundcloud was extremely important to me as a young female producer, and was one of the first community-driven platforms to give me a voice and enable me to share my music with thousands of people before I had any sort of following or cosign. These early releases opened so many doors for me  that I would not have had access to otherwise (like getting discovered and reposted by Soulection, creating Team Supreme with my friends, and giving one of my instrumentals to SZA as an unknown producer), so it feels right to me that a significant portion of profits from that music should be invested in women's rights.","duration":213.551,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x92526b99715afeed324fb56ecafcac8056379300/higher-higher-1661355235","image":"ipfs://Qmcy5KmzUBJGP9qCyk5JK5SqheWrmt1pkJfMkj9nm3J6DS","losslessAudio":"ipfs://Qmf6CW3h2woifFK6jCjYAaMzWUx3s7b9zP5FT5n22MFavT","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"dot - Higher Higher","title":"Higher Higher","version":"catalog-20220222"}}

Its haunting melody exhorts the listener to take comfort in the unknown, in solitude, and even in danger.\r\n\r\n\"There is safety in darkness /\r\nbut not if you fear it\"\r\n\r\n...is the only line that repeats. Evocative images appear in the song's bridge, in particular windswept cliffs by the sea and rain-drenched tree canopies towering above, swaying from fierce hurricanes in the darkness of night, providing no shelter or warmth.\r\n\r\n// Station 2 // Field Notes\r\n\r\nA striking and unusual song, especially as compared to the lullabies genre near-universally. We have found that most lullaby lyrics attempt a direct approach towards assuaging the fears of a loved one, through assurances of safety and expressions of care.\r\n\r\nIn \"The Wild Forest Reigns\", the listener is reminded that she is alone, that her insignificance, amidst nature's awesome powers, is the thing to be celebrated. Though the words and music are not harsh, and in fact are at times quite beautiful, they also cannot be described to swaddle or coddle the intended audience.\r\n\r\nWhen we interviewed performers of this lullaby – found prevalently among cultures regardless of proximity to wilderness regions – we often encountered an ardent belief that this lullaby occupied an important place within the Pleiadians' sense of self-identification. Its comportment with that fierce and even rugged independence Pleiadians are known for sits nonetheless alongside a delighted, mirthful awareness that the dangers of the world hold their own unique power to affirm joy and life.\r\n\r\n// Station 3 // Collector Perks\r\n\r\nThis is a 1/1 Catalog NFT track composed, performed, and pressed by Eric Pan (pandelic.eth).\r\n\r\nEvery owner of a pandelic.eth Catalog NFT also receives unlimited, “golden ticket” download access to Eric's entire published music catalog, in resolutions up to MP3 V0 and lossless WAV.

LULLABIES OF THE PLEIADES collects six solo piano pieces transcribed from indigenous Pleiadian songs, each as sung to a young loved one, local to the far constellation. \r\n\r\nThis exoplanetary musicology project aims to amplify previously undocumented music and its connected folklore, with more research findings to come.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nfield notes excerpt 1. origins\r\n\r\nthe Pleiadians became aware, early on, of their role as beacon and source of wonder. That anyone who saw their bouquet of stars, no matter how distant, would thereafter look to them in search for answers. That they would be listened to—and so what they say should not lead the rest of us astray.\r\n\r\nSwift was their realization that music was the ideal language to communicate wishes, context, and emotion. and so naturally the songs they played for each other carried the same glowing power when broadcast outward, for anyone who didn’t understand their spoken languages.\r\n\r\nThe lullaby is complete.\r\n\r\nA self-contained intention.\r\n\r\n(A gift and a blessing.)\r\n\r\nthe deep care of a lullaby is transmitted across time, across distances so vast that years are needed for light to bridge the gap.\r\n\r\n“I’ll sing to you, so that you might find peace more easily.”\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nfield notes excerpt 2. journey to earth\r\n\r\nAll composition is ethnomusicology, if you’re lucky.\r\n\r\nWhile I cannot vouch for my own luck, and I cannot be certain I have transcribed these Pleiadian lullabies with sufficient accuracy — such that the Pleiadians themselves could still feel their full import — I have tried my best for now. I have sensed that the piano, as an instrument, is unfamiliar to them, but in the end is serviceable for the purposes of transcription.\r\n\r\nGathering the songs began with a process of sitting in stillness, the better by which to detect currents in the air. Then, like sifting particles of sand lifted by wind, I could listen for patterns, the frequencies scattered and embedded in shared consciousness, the imprint of grooves left from countless repetitions of the same gestures of care, given and then continuously passed along. an ancient and timeless wisdom. The endless circulation of blood through the body is an apt metaphor for the rejuvenating effect of songs repeated and echoed across time.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nfield notes excerpt 3. the increase\r\n\r\nI am hard-pressed to identify when, exactly, this collection of songs changed me. I had felt that the transmission was complete, at least for the time being. As I played and re-played them for myself, familiarizing my ears and listening for what messages they spoke, I came to realize that each lullaby held ever deeper secrets that I felt unable to plumb.\r\n\r\n…a different day, performing a different one, with a different disposition, might reveal a new facet of a song, the way an answer might glimmer from the depths of a gemstone with light shone upon it, precisely angled — though in the case of this music, perhaps not to be found again.\r\n\r\nThe whole of each lullaby was beyond my comprehension, and my efforts to document or understand their meaning seemed thwarted at every renewed attempt, as if to be told: “What you seek cannot be found here.”\r\n\r\n+\r\ngradually I came to realize that my exploration of this music would change dramatically between renditions, especially contrasting playing alone against playing for others.\r\n+ it might not be the lullabies themselves which hold power but the act of giving them.\r\n\r\nit is now clear to me … the stability and longevity of these lullabies depends upon passing them on. They have arrived at our present place and time due to each sharing that came before, from one caretaker to a loved one, a gifting of heart and time cupped with both hands.\r\n\r\nThis awareness has brought me to an imperative — that I let go of the Lullabies of the Pleiades, as well as the need to keep them close to me, for intimate study, as if I’d isolated them to petri dishes. It is better that I give them out, and not reservedly, but with clarion gusto. (this step also makes it possible for anyone else to take these songs of care, understand and even transform them in their own way: sing them to another, releasing them into freedom again, increasing their potency with each gifting."},"title":"The Wild Forest Reigns","trackNumber":6,"version":"catalog-20220222"}}

We were both crushed and devastated the day we found out and still decided to go to dinner reservations that same night. \r\n\r\nAfter that very tough conversation, I found out I had a lot to learn about the infertility journey we were about to embark on. However, one night while watching a series on Netflix, there was a scene where a woman who was also diagnosed with infertility went to a support group for other women dealing with the same. During the session, the group leader asked them to repeat the phrase “I am not broken.”\r\n\r\nA light bulb went off! I had already been on my computer, messing with some production and immediately began recording the chords and finding the drum rhythms to what became the song that is now.\r\n\r\nI initially wanted the record to just be for my wife but she urged me to put it on my most recent Gold Fangs On Sunday album. Since then, we’ve shot visuals and the song alone before and after release has touched so many women who deal with infertility and image insecurities. \r\n\r\nUTILITY:\r\n\r\n-\tThe collector will be inducted into the Gold Fangs Society which comes with its own set of perks and privileges that will be later revealed.\r\n-\tThe collector will also receive a 1 of 1 pat junior t-shirt.

Originally created with the intent of being released on \"The Uproot\".  It was one of four songs I pulled last minute to include on \"Chill Gawd, Chill\" to showcase more current music since the Majority of Chill Gawd, Chill was created 2012-2013.\r\n\r\n ( https://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/the-uproot )\r\n\r\nThe theme & inspiration of the song was in line with most of music created for \"The Uproot\" which was rebelling against the current Meta and Trend of the time (which is still relevant) of switching up to making more short, upbeat, dance type music.   I have nothing  against short songs,  upbeat or dance music.  I make that type of music as well but the majority of people at the time were pivoting so hard from their originally identity,  that I couldn't tell who's music was who in a blind listening test and I was pretty vocal about it which didn't earn me any  \"cool points\" haha.   I missed hearing music that rewarded the patient ear with slow builds and subtle changes and told a story, so I decided to stop worrying about what anyone else was creating and be the change I wanted to see.

The age of beat collectives,  I was apart of so many during the soundcloud era (Astral Basement, Soulection, FlyByNight, Expansions Collective, Cosmic Compositions,  Collective Resonance, Rootnote collective , etc)   \r\n\r\nIt wasn't until July 19th 2013  I got to meet RND1 in person for the first time at the Astral Basement show for Beat Soup at PooBah Records (Rest in Peace Ras G)  in Pasadena.   I remember meeting RND1 for the 1st time and him being so shy and quiet in person,  I noticed he looked cold so I gave him my Jacket to wear (something he must of really appreciated because I forgot about this but it's something that stuck with him for years to follow as he always reminds me) It was crazy to me this producer that I basically fanned out over constantly was so humble and reserved and we just clicked instantly.   RND1,  like most amazing producers I know has the all too common \"BEAT HOARDER\" syndrome.  He does release music,  but I have countless folders upon folders of the greatest music I've ever heard dating as far back as 2012 and he's yet to release any of it haha.   We grew closer as friends after I moved away from Los Angeles and he was the first person I went to for beats when I was living in New York and entertaining the idea of recording another \"Dutchmassive\" album.   He sent me batch after batch and instead of writing to anything, a new series would be born.  \"DailyRambles\" (The Reluctant Clap)  A series where I would blindly load up batches of beats I haven't listened to yet on my portable Tascam DR-05 and attempt to Freestyle over whatever I hear (this was my way of gauging if a beat had potential to sit and write to) and while I didn't end up writing or recording another \"Dutchmassive\" album,  I recorded 6 years worth of freestyles (Dailyrambles) and that all started by RND1 sending batches of absolute heat.  \r\n\r\nIn 2015,  I moved from New York back to my home town of Tampa, FL which came with very different energy and challenges than I had living on a secluded mountain in NY or the overstimulating energy of Living in Los Angeles,  So I decided to finish an album I began while living in Los Angeles, continued in New York and now would close that Chapter back in the state I tried my hardest to escape.  It was really important that I had a collab with RND1 on this project, so he sent me batch of beats he recently started and I didn't even make it through the entire folder before asking him to send me the Ableton Session for this beat. Most of ground work had already been laid, but I was able to go in and Dutchify it up enough adding an intro, horns, layered chops, some drums and drop outs etc but this is the one collab where I can say,  I didn't do most of the heavy lifting.   Usually I just get a drum loop and then do everything from there with very few exceptions.   There's much more to the RND1 x Dutchyyy story,  but we will pick back up where we left off in future backstories for future uploads.  To Be Continued  =)\r\n\r\n\"Stop Sleeping In So Much\" was the 2nd to last song created for \"Traversal\" and I'm very thankful to have crossed paths with RND1 and gained a best friend / brother in process.\r\n\r\none of my favorite instrumental albums of all time is by RND1\r\n\r\nhttps://trashsupply.bandcamp.com/album/imaginary-wknd\r\n\r\nYou can find more of his music here:\r\nhttps://rnd1.bandcamp.com/\r\nhttps://soundcloud.com/rnd1 \r\n\r\nand hopefully soon @ https://beta.catalog.works/rnd1\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to experience \"Traversal\" the way it was intended to be digested.

Please find my statement on the issue below:\r\n\r\nIt's taken me some time to speak up about the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade -- words like \"saddened,\" \"disgusted,\" or \"horrified\" don't begin to cover the ranges of emotions I've felt since reading abortion rights headlines day after day. It's hard for me to gather thoughts on an issue that seems completely illogical. \r\n\r\nWomen have the right to choose what to do with their bodies. Women have the right to decide if and when they want to be mothers. Women's access to basic healthcare is not up for debate. I KNOW that women have the same basic human rights as all people on this planet, regardless of what few individuals in power or larger institutions may try to do to suppress that right. This is a truth that I will continue to live by, and continue to fight for no matter the situation. \r\n\r\nMy performance in Los Angeles last week was one of the more difficult sets I've had in recent memory. Playing music and connecting with people is usually my favorite thing in the world, but I couldn't shake this shadow of awareness that according to many institutions, I don't have the same rights as my male peers on that same stage. And this privilege of getting up in front of audiences to share music that I created is something that very few women have access to. \r\n\r\nA USC study completed in 2020 showed that less than 2% of music producers in the industry are women, and while this number may be shocking to some, it makes perfect sense to me when you consider the centuries of oppression and violence against us that continue to seep into modern politics and healthcare practices. If we want to see more women excel in music (or any field), we must address the underlying issues that keep us from living our lives as equals instead of subordinates. \r\n\r\nToday I'm launching a new series of music NFTs on Catalog titled \"Early Days\" of music I released on Soundcloud from 2012-2018, and I'm donating 50% of all sales from this series to the National Network of Abortion Funds, and to Planned Parenthood. Soundcloud was extremely important to me as a young female producer, and was one of the first community-driven platforms to give me a voice and enable me to share my music with thousands of people before I had any sort of following or cosign. These early releases opened so many doors for me  that I would not have had access to otherwise (like getting discovered and reposted by Soulection, creating Team Supreme with my friends, and giving one of my instrumentals to SZA as an unknown producer), so it feels right to me that a significant portion of profits from that music should be invested in women's rights.","duration":171.781,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x92526b99715afeed324fb56ecafcac8056379300/nova-s-theme-demo-mix--1663211453","image":"ipfs://Qmcy5KmzUBJGP9qCyk5JK5SqheWrmt1pkJfMkj9nm3J6DS","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmQiWdsbbuMfveZoZrj7TfSvMX64jyhEDnXY8zDTKSykgK","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"dot - Nova's Theme [Demo Mix]","title":"Nova's Theme [Demo Mix]","version":"catalog-20220222"}}

With this album, Wylie attempts to capture that feeling of creative freedom and bliss, a sonic journal, a collection of thoughts, feelings and experiences that the artist savored and with each song tries to provide a small glimpse into the life of its creator.\r\n\r\nCable’s collaboration with Gene Coye is the most direct reference to this influence with the title of their track, “The Montreux Palace Hotel,” building on the first connections they made during their time at CalArts when Cable took drum lessons from Gene Coye, and the extensive roads each has travelled through music since. Extensive instruments were used to construct Warmed By The Sun, including the Oberheim Viscount Joint Venture OB3, The Kitten by Octave, Roland JP-08, Roland TR-8, Moog Sirin, Arturia Keystep, and Ableton Live with stock ableton soft synths and effects. The record also features original samples graciously sent from friends of Cable, including Mike Gao, Debroka, Elusive, Lightfoot, Carmack, and Paint (Huxley Anne & Tsuruda). Mastering for Warmed By The Sun was completed this summer by Grammy Award winning engineer Daddy Kev at his Cosmic Zoo facility in LA.\r\n\r\nConjoining structured songwriting elements within the vast spectrum of the beat scene’s unwavering search for new harmonic and rhythmic identity, Warmed By The Sun serves as Cable’s most forward thinking and adventurous work in that context. Emotionally provocative and energetically transfixing, Warmed By The Sun embodies the direct meaning of the LP title and goes into the bliss state of music creation where genre or scene are in the rearview. “The simple interpretation seems to me to just be the feeling of being warmed by the sun, sitting on a beach or in a park or on a hot rock and just relaxing and feeling safe and at peace.\" Cable explains. \"I feel like the phrase has a sort of holistic and healing or comforting feeling to it naturally. Since this is for a mixtape and will also be pressed on tape, and since I was thinking about that format specifically when I made the collage for the cover, it occurred to me that there is sort of a secret inside joke about tapes getting left out in the sun and getting warped. Warped tapes have also been an important sample source throughout time and I've even actually physically done that in the past where I left tapes out in the sun and then resampled them to get weird sounds. Have to give credit for that idea to my friend Chris Adams aka AHEE, he used to warp tapes and use them as samples in his old found sound / music concrete releases we did in the early days of the label.”\r\n\r\nWarmed By The Sun, like all of Cable's works, erases the notion of monolith and raises the flag of community and diversity. Tracks like “New Loops,” “French 75,” “Conn Loyalist,” and “Ahmad’s Blue ‘73 Coupe” are reminiscent of the era when artists such as Dibiase, Knxwledge, Jonwayne, and Samiyam began sparking waves in the name of beat scene. Album opener, “Alone,” is Cable’s most dynamic song to date, immersed in stark lyricism that interweaves around fast traveling synth tandem lines and slow grooving drums that splinter outward during that track’s final moments of instrumentalism. “Big Brane Debroka Flip'' is pure low end bass bliss, with a ruptured and deepened atmosphere of sound interwoven into the sampled flute, synth, and DJ scratches. A continued state of musical excavation into modern bass forms presents itself in tracks like “Crystal Lattice Structure,” “Cute Gesture,” “Butterfly Knife,” “Norwich Drill (145bpm)\", and “Rose & Thorn.” The dynamics and songwriting push even further with tracks like “Moderatto Allegretto,” “Wall of Nets,” “John Carmack,” “Run For Your Money (Third Take)” and “Kanzo Flip,” showcasing a commanding sense of musical interplay, exploration, chance taking, and tonal presence that pushes the album far out of time constraints of scene or replication. Percussion and bass aren’t the only elements carrying a heavy presence and adding that emotional weight, with the magnetic and spiritual feeling of “Dirty Tape Flip (With Melody)” capturing an entirely different side of Cable’s vision as an artist and instrumentalist. The decomposing and glowing essence of tape reverberates through every tone, shimmering with a special emotion that is truly one of a kind. “Vespia Piaggo” features one of Mexico City's most potent lyricists, Speak, building out landscape after landscape of poetic virtuosity, verbally dashing over vibrating synth pulses, jazz fuelled piano lines, and pocket landing drum lines. Futuristic and advanced levels of hip-hop music that pulls from the ethos of organic rap creators from all generations. The album’s closer, “Indistinct Chattering,” strips away all of the electronics, power and grind of the tracks prior, with Cable playing guitar and bass parts, and also singing an original work that summarizes the totality of the LP’s meaning conceptually and musically.\r\n\r\nWarmed By The Sun was a moment of self realization for Cable just as much as it was an act of expression. Cable reflects on this state of interaction with his art. “I think if anything what has changed for me creatively on this record is that I've come to a full circle realization moment about how and why I want to make art. I don't feel like I'm chasing any trends or trying to sound like any specific style or genre on this record, it's really just an authentic expression of me having fun and exploring my creativity through audio and making compositions. That is something I always look for in artists I sign to the label so it feels good to be in a similar creative space in my own personal journey. I think it's especially important for me to continue to create art and release my work while I run the label because it keeps me directly in touch with the creative process so I can have realistic and meaningful conversations with the artists I work with about their own projects, and come from a place of real life experience and understanding, rather than some cold number crunching business perspective.”\r\n\r\nCable’s last full-length album, Shimmer, Then Disappear, launched in September of 2020, with critical acclaim met by Bandcamp Daily, XLR8R, BBC6, Dancing Astronaut, and more. The album showcased the blueprint for the many forms of music that had been soaked into the fabric of the Dome of Doom label over the last few years and Warmed By The Sun carries that torch further. Launching the decade spanning label compilation Decade of Doom in September of 2021, Cable took an extra year to compose music and tap into a multitude of creative forms during this woodshedding experience. It had been a number of years since Cable had taken off a full-year of releasing music, armed to the teeth with new tracks that became the basis to his most dynamic body of work. Warmed By The Sun drops September 23rd on Dome of Doom and will be available worldwide on digital and limited edition cassette formats.\r\n\r\nTrack Listing\r\n\r\n1. Alone\r\n2.

Step aboard here, to embark – together we'll roam city and sea and stars.\r\n\r\nThis is the complete LP for Travel Poems . Chapter 1 . Secret towns in pure form, uniquely as one continuous journey.\r\n\r\n// Station B // Waypoints\r\n\r\nThe air is made of music.\r\n\r\nAtoms play, particles dance, ripe notes fall from shaking trees. Wherever we go, melodies appear — soundtracks begin performing themselves.\r\n\r\nThis collection of Travel Poems was composed around the world, recorded on dozens of pianos, each song carrying, bottled, the essence of a place in a peculiar moment. Each song is a postcard.\r\n\r\nEvery postcard comes from somewhere. Just as important, the recipient of a postcard is, however faintly and briefly, transported to the location+mind coordinates of its authorship.\r\n\r\nSo it might seem.\r\n\r\n0:00 Gare du Nord\r\n2:57 Periscope Forest\r\n4:26 Discovery after Dark\r\n7:45 Stranded Awake\r\n10:35 Majesty of the Minute\r\n16:31 Foot of the Carpathians\r\n22:17 Up Jakupica\r\n23:55 Hamstrung\r\n25:02 Wheelhouse of Wonder (Welcome Home)\r\n29:44 Epilogue\r\n\r\n// Station C // Track Notes\r\n\r\n01 – Gare du Nord\r\n\r\nClaire, I’m writing you from a train station in Paris, which is less a place to be, than a total displacement. For 3 days it’s been raining over us, a constant mist that soaks my head immediately upon peeking outside. So I stay in, looking out, confined by my own feet. It’s my exterminating angel. I feel lonely and extinguished.\r\n\r\nThis song comes from the illusion of loneliness.\r\nAn internal compass is somewhere, waiting to be rediscovered.\r\n\r\nSolo piano by Eric Pan, recorded at Imperial College London.\r\n\r\nScored with found sounds credited to these curators: vflefevre (Krakow) / barcelonetasonora (Barceloneta) / avakas (Greece) / Rapoix / Eelke\r\n\r\n02 – Periscope Forest\r\n\r\nClaire, Taipei is glorious...it’s as though the people can just stay still and the food teems around us. I pop my head up above the crowd to see if a dessert cart might be coming around again. I’ll be ready next time. What a huge village. Everywhere must be fun because either teenagers or workers are laughing. Under the veneer I can tell we’re all meerkats.\r\n\r\nThis song comes from the vibrancy of chaos.\r\n\r\nSolo piano by Eric Pan, recorded at the Hsin-Chu Hospital Towers. \r\n\r\nScored with found sounds credited to these curators: adamb1026 (Belfast) / hafdisgitar (Reykjavik) / Pfannkuchn (Hamburg)\r\n\r\n03 – Discovery after Dark\r\n\r\nClaire, I met someone. She talks nonstop, and interrupts me all the time, just the way you do. I love it. We met on an overnight train to D.C. and immediately started chatting about why Camus thinks traveling reaches its fullest potential when we are acting from our fears. Nonsense, I think. So then she disagrees with me on everything, it’s such a thrill. I wish I could see the look on your face right now.\r\n\r\nThis song comes from sharing a bubble with a new person.\r\n\r\nPiano trio recorded at TRIXX Studios, Berlin, with Eric Pan (piano), Nir Sabag (drums), and Hugo Reydet (bass).\r\n\r\nScored with found sounds credited to these curators: fryzu82 / harrybates01 / richists / sirderf / thaighaudio\r\n\r\n04 – Stranded Awake\r\n\r\nClaire. Have you ever felt so lost, even your sense of self is in question? I’m in an attic in the Haight. I’m running through a forest of thoughts and anxieties. But I don’t think they’re my own. You always talk about opening your heart & even your pores to the world...that’s the best way to get soaked by other people’s worries no? The ambient malaise just floating around. With this fog I can’t see what I’m supposed to do with my time here. Beam me a sign through your tropical sunglasses.\r\n\r\nThis song comes from the grand search for meaning.\r\n\r\nSolo Fender Rhodes by Eric Pan, recorded in Brooklyn.\r\n\r\nScored with found sounds credited to these curators: jmbphilmes / animationisaac / ultradust (Seoul) / InspectorJ (U.K.) / schneiderfilmchen\r\n\r\n05 – Majesty of the Minute\r\n\r\nClaire, I think I’ve mastered time. If you want something to go by quickly, just snap your fingers. Now if you want something to go by slowly that’s harder, but it can be done too. I’m doing it right now. The evening is so pleasant here in Sedona, when the desert cools, and you just see the silhouettes of the saguaros. We all hold a pose sometimes. This specific dusk, I think it can last forever, if I allow it. By the time you read this, I’ll still be here.\r\n\r\nThis song comes from the immensity of the smallest measure of peace.\r\n\r\nSolo piano by Eric Pan, recorded in Julian, CA.\r\n\r\nScored with found sounds credited to these curators: Freqman / matiasromero / ultradust (Seoul) / Thalamus_Lab (Great Barrier Reef )\r\n\r\n06 – Foot of the Carpathians\r\n\r\nClaire, we have to attend the circus together sometime. I was wandering in Krakow, entirely aimless, when two fellow travelers welcomed me on their journey out of town. Come sunset, I’m surrounded by nomads making a caravan camp near the mountains, trying to sing songs in Ukrainian with them. Bonfire parties with guitar music transcend all cultural boundaries. It’s a vast country out here, and the universe continues its expansion.\r\n\r\nThis song comes from wilderness.\r\n\r\nPiano trio recorded at TRIXX Studios, Berlin, with Eric Pan (piano), Nir Sabag (drums), and Hugo Reydet (bass).\r\n\r\nScored with found sounds credited to these curators: spt3125 / stefanhoevenaar / colinsullivan (California) / unfa\r\n\r\n07 – Up Jakupica\r\n\r\nClairest, Hello from Solunska Glava, the sun has probably kept me lively for several days, I’m delirious with joy. My new favorite word is teleférique. Blanket me in bird feathers, I’ll sail straight to you on one continuous breeze. That’s how fortune- filled I feel. It’s so idyllic on these grassy peaks, each roaming animal more furry than the next. I’m convinced the ancient Macedonians basked like these stones and stored the heat in their bodies, humming all the while.\r\n\r\nThis song comes from childlike flights of fancy.\r\n\r\nSolo piano by Eric Pan, recorded in Berlin at Maria’s house.\r\n\r\nScored with found sounds credited to these curators: unfa / MrAuralization / Skjor1 (Cornwall)\r\n\r\n08 – Hamstrung\r\n\r\nClaire, the magic in this world, is it evenly spread? It could be hidden in easter eggs, or carefree like dandelions when scattered. I hope it looks after us from time to time. I’m in the cloudforest of Monteverde, nursing a heartbreak that should have been gone by now. I think it’s a burrower. It’s my secret companion no one knows about unless they cut me open and read my tree rings.\r\n\r\nThis song comes from being severed from the source.\r\n\r\nSolo piano by Eric Pan, recorded in Liberia, Costa Rica.\r\n\r\nScored with found sounds credited to these curators: reinsamba (Karlsruhe) / JonathanTremblay / elliotrambach (Detroit, MI)\r\n\r\n09 – Wheelhouse of Wonder (Welcome Home)\r\n\r\nClaire, I think it’s wild that the feeling of home can change. It can become untethered from geography, it can become a person. It can even disappear completely. I think I’ve experienced all these variations. Can it be somewhere I’ve never even visited, except only in my mind? This is Phuket, Thailand, and nowhere. When I was a child I built a toy village, and would imagine becoming tiny and moving in with them. Can home be the whole world?\r\n\r\nThis song comes from the encounter with the other.\r\n\r\nPiano trio recorded at TRIXX Studios, Berlin, with Eric Pan (piano), Nir Sabag (drums), and Hugo Reydet (bass).\r\n\r\nScored with found sounds credited to these curators: satiw4c (New South Wales)\r\n\r\n10 – Epilogue\r\n\r\nScored with found sounds credited to these curators: SFindigo (San Francisco) / AGFX\r\n\r\n// Station D // Collector Perks\r\n\r\nThis is a 1/1 Catalog NFT album (minted uniquely as one continuous track) composed, performed, and pressed by Eric Pan (pandelic.eth).\r\n\r\nEvery owner of a pandelic.eth Catalog NFT also receives unlimited, “golden ticket” download access to Eric's entire published music catalog, in resolutions up to MP3 V0 and lossless WAV.

When I say last, I mean it did not even exist 48 hrs prior to the album being released .  The title track was created in Upstate NY at Sam's Point Nature Preserve on Feb 4th, 2014 the day prior to the Album being stealth released and immediately selling out on Feb 5th 2015.  \r\n\"Chill Gawd, Chill\" held Bandcamp's top selling HipHop Cassette and Digital release for 2 weeks straight long after all copies were sold out. Before we get into how and why this particular track was made, let's time travel back to 2012 and visit my tiny apartment in San Pedro, CA. overlooking the Port of Los Angeles where this album first began.\r\n\r\nSince this backstory will be revisited in detail in the near future when I mint the song \"Medutayshun\" (f/ Ahwlee) I'll Just summarize the important part.  My friend Kronika / Angel of Soulection introduced me to a produced named \"Ahwlee\".  We vibed and clicked pretty fast and he would come stay at my apartment and we would both be making beats in headphones on separate laptops,  Him on Ableton and me on FL Studio.  Long Story Short,  after multiple visits of him making entire albums in Ableton Live  while I was still working on One beat in FL Studio,  I finally asked him to teach me Ableton.  The next morning (May 16th 2012), We put that teaching into practice and collaborated on our first track. Him on drums, synths and me on chops. We knocked this track out in a matter of minutes, and exported the track.  He packed up his laptop and headed home and as soon as he left, I immediately uploaded the track to Soundcloud ( https://soundcloud.com/dutchmassive/ahwleexdutchy-meduhtayshun ) and history was made.  While I didn't know at the time,  this would become the first track created for \"Chill Gawd, Chill\".\r\n\r\nFor the following week I would make a few more beats in FL Studio (which ended up on my album \"Blue Screen of Deaf) and I was getting frustrated with how long everything took compared to Ableton.  Ahwlee came back over on my birthday (May 23rd 2012) with the intention of installing Ableton onto my laptop.   I decided to close a chapter in my life and made my very beat in FL Studio titled \"Just Be Yourself\" (which was the first track from the album I minted on Catalog that @StvdioNoveau /  @snvault  just collected which unlocked the title track of \"Chill Gawd, Chill\" to be minted for a chance to unlock the album to DSP's) - https://beta.catalog.works/dutchyyy/-just-be-yourself-\r\n\r\nTo bring us back on track,  Ceremoniously closing the chapter and giving FL Studio a proper send off was like being reborn.  I immediately dove into Ableton Live and started cranking out music I loved at a rapid rate.  Going from FL Studio to Ableton was like taking ankle weights and chains off.   I was having so much fun, and I was able to execute ideas very very quickly.  Over the next 2 years, I made a lot of music, collabed with alot of my friends and every song was done in 15minutes to an hour max.  Fast forward to mid 2013, while living in a new apartment in Hawthorne, A ridiculous chain of events would happen that would create a new Arc for how I approached music.  Times were heavy, my heart was broken so the music became more intentional.   After a nasty breakup and nearly tossing my laptop out of the window, my friend Kaelin Ellis called me to calm me down and convinced me to take all that pain and anger and channel it into making music.  After we hung up,  I created \"The Firelighter\" which became the first track created for what was meant to be my next album \"The Uproot\". After that night,  There was a different energy attached to what I was creating.  Shortly after, I lost my job at Warner Brothers, got evicted from my apartment and was painfully ejected from Los Angeles.  After a short return back home to Tampa, FL I moved to Upstate NY and went through a little more pain before finally achieving peace on a secluded mountain where my spirit, outlook and sound would evolve.  (you can read more about that back story here - https://beta.catalog.works/dutchyyy/set-your-intentions )  The Reality is,  I had so much new music I was excited to release which became the albums \"The Uproot\" & \"Traversal\" which I wanted to release as a double album telling a full very intentional story. \r\nbut I was sitting on so much unreleased music that I made while in Los Angeles and it felt weird releasing this super heavy double album while all this other unreleased music that represented a whole Arc of life where I was just having fun was still in limbo.  So I started sorting all of that music and decided to release the older music first on cassette.  I realized I had too many songs to fit on a 90 minute Tape,  So I decided to press a 120 minute Cassette.  At the last minute, I lost a few tracks due to corrupted  Ableton projects so I filled in the gaps by pulling 4 songs from \"The Uproot\" which I regret.  At the time, I was able to justify it in my mind because, everything else was so old and didn't really represent where I was currently at musically so I added \"The Scramble\" / \"Evolution of a Shrug\" / \"Lamb's Bread\" / & \"OneForShoes\" to fill out the cassette.  This choice would eventually come back to haunt me and become the catalyst of years of hoarding music due to releasing music out of order from when it was created which seems silly but Chronological documentation has always been something I value.    \r\n\r\nTo wrap this up where we first began in this story,  It was the day before I planned to release the album I titled \"Chill Gawd, Chill\"  An album I titled in response to everyone asking non stop when I would drop a new album. I've been burning \"Nag Champa\" incense ritualistically since the mid 90's.  Nearly every beat on that album was created with smoke drifting in the air,  I got all of my friends in Los Angeles hooked on burning Nag Champa and the album also represented a period in my life where I was super chill and didn't approach music with too much intent or heaviness so I had my friend DJ (PeaceOutPremiere) to Design the cover artwork and stickers,  and attached stickers to boxes of Nag Champa to mail out with the tapes but something was missing.  The album needed one final track, created with intent to convey the overall vibe of the album.  The entire album was full of sample chops,  but while I was on the mountain, I also started making music under the alias \"Sonofziggy\" which was no samples,  just one take, live recorded long form sessions of me blindly playing keys and instruments.  So for the final track,  I wanted to sample myself,  So I played some keys,  Then I chopped up my own recording like I would any other sample, laid some drums,  Played some more keys, bass and synths and Bounced out a song live in one take, and thus was born the title track to the 2 hour tape \"Chill Gawd, Chill\"\r\n\r\nThe next day, I quietly dropped the album on Bandcamp with pre-orders for the Cassette. It sold out immediately and was Bandcamp's best selling Cassette. Due to high demand and fomo, I was pressured into doing a second pressing of Cassette w/ Nag Champa which dropped on my birthday, May 23rd 2016. Once again, it sold out immediately and was Bandcamp's best selling cassette for 2 weeks in a row. Obviously, my most popular / successful instrumental album as Dutchyyy (fka Dutchy) the demand to upload this to streaming was unbearable. To this Day, \"Chill Gawd, Chill\" remains only available on bandcamp. In fall of 2020, I did one final pressing of the two hour tape w/ Nag Champa. It was the last time I will press \"this version\" of the cassette","duration":187.115,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x26ef03a20aaeda8aafcee4e146dc6b328195947c/-chill-gawd-chill--1664325688","image":"ipfs://QmY2WeFYhq9Ng1FSw92L1B1LPX6LNXE1ZnxL95XZsWeuWj","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmXZovDRYHmxsaGQhYw7NAEfJ47qsoinnjZ65xJZ6z2QuB","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"Dutchyyy - \"Chill Gawd, Chill\"","project":{"artwork":{"uri":"ipfs://QmY2WeFYhq9Ng1FSw92L1B1LPX6LNXE1ZnxL95XZsWeuWj","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},"title":"Chill Gawd, Chill","description":"Artist: Dutchyyy\r\nAlbum Title:  \"Chill Gawd, Chill\" \r\nRuntime: 120 minutes\r\nRelease Date: February 5th, 2015 \r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\nSIDE A\r\n\r\n1.

Step aboard here, to embark – together we'll roam city and sea and stars.\r\n\r\nThis is the complete LP for Travel Poems . Chapter 2 . The night sea in pure form, uniquely as one continuous journey.\r\n\r\nAs of this pressing, there are 3 chapters of Travel Poems, each a distinct story.\r\n\r\n// Station B // Waypoints\r\n\r\nThe air is made of music.\r\n\r\nAtoms play, particles dance, ripe notes fall from shaking trees. Wherever we go, melodies appear — soundtracks begin performing themselves.\r\n\r\nThis collection of Travel Poems was composed around the world, recorded on dozens of pianos, each song carrying, bottled, the essence of a place in a peculiar moment. Each song is a postcard.\r\n\r\nEvery postcard comes from somewhere. Just as important, the recipient of a postcard is, however faintly and briefly, transported to the location+mind coordinates of its authorship.\r\n\r\nSo it might seem.\r\n\r\n// Station C // Track Notes\r\n\r\n0:00 de Lune Mécanique\r\n1:52 Loss\r\n3:28 The Storm Heaves in the Distance\r\n8:16 Oak Island\r\n11:22 Teufelssee Tower\r\n17:19 Fine Day to Risk It All\r\n20:46 On Old Delancey\r\n22:35 Noguchi Beach\r\n28:22 Turtle on the Moon\r\n31:34 Epilogue\r\n\r\n01 – de Lune Mécanique\r\n\r\ndear Claire, the day is unwound, like the springs of a clock, slowing to a stop. Your words pass through me when I see a sky filled with clouds, those really big ones, when they are the size of gods and it seems impossible that they might dissipate, but of course they do, the moment we stop noticing. I wish to cultivate that magic ... the ability to traverse into another realm, under the illusion of disappearance.\r\n\r\nThis song comes from memories of the first caretaker.\r\n\r\nSolo Fender Rhodes by Eric Pan, recorded in Cemetery  Friedhof Lilienthalstraße, Berlin, Germany.\r\n\r\nScored with found sounds credited to these curators: Eircom / Silencyo / Leandros.Ntounis / Rhapsodize / FractalStudios\r\n\r\n02 – Loss\r\n\r\nClaire, you once said that life is not complicated, but impossible to understand. I feel it now. I know this is mourning and yet I’ve no idea how to mourn. I don’t know if I even existed in the same universe as she did. You know, these libraries of shared memories, I can roam the hallways endlessly. They’re transcendent. So when I also die, this architecture still stands. Sunlight pools on the courtyard stones, and streams through the wood window frames. The garden sprouts with flowers anew even without witness.\r\n\r\nThis song comes from the universal constant.\r\n\r\nSolo piano by Eric Pan, recorded in Greenwich Village, New York.\r\n\r\nScored with found sounds credited to these curators: Lgarrett / Vampirella17 / Glaneur de sons / Leosalom / Northern87\r\n\r\n03 – The Storm Heaves in the Distance\r\n\r\nClaire, is there anything so exciting as an approaching conflagration? I invite you to join me: burrow NOW through this postcard, following the twists and spins of this very personalized, one-of-a-kind wormhole I have hand-crafted for you (just say “yes” to wending your way through time and space™), and let’s climb above the McKibben Lofts to watch the incoming fury together (popcorn included).\r\n\r\nThis song comes from the angel protectorate.\r\n\r\nRecorded at TRIXX Studios, Berlin, with Eric Pan (Fender Rhodes), Nir Sabag (drums), and Hugo Reydet (bass).\r\n\r\nScored with found sounds credited to these curators: Juskiddink / Therabidfrog / FlatHill / YleArkisto / Yoyodaman234 / SpliceSound / InspectorJ\r\n\r\n04 – Oak Island\r\n\r\nClaire, this is going to drive you crazy, so be it (ha). I want you to tell me more about that kiss you shared with a stranger who rode up on her bike near the Williamsburg bridge. Aren’t there any extra details you have been keeping secret, or that you can remember in a flash when prompted spontaneously, oh for example, now?? It’s such a crucial parable for our times I think. The hero we need, etc. Hello from Ometepe where the water is divine.\r\n\r\nThis song comes from conspiratorial love and its hidden excitements.\r\n\r\nRecorded at Douglass Studios, Brooklyn, with Eric Pan (piano), Sebastian Chiriboga (drums), and Dean Torrey (bass).\r\n\r\nScored with found sounds credited to these curators: TheWorkingBamboo / CasaAsiaSons\r\n\r\n05 – Teufelssee Tower\r\n\r\nClaire my sweet, I have been blessed with extraordinary luck. One part of it is knowing you are somewhere, ear bent in kindness and infinite wisdom, my lifeline even amid the most absurd times. The other part is — guess who just played a pipe organ from 1435? I can’t even believe that is a possible year that once was like a “thing”. Just imagine walking down the street and getting cross at some young adult punks who grew up in the 1420s.\r\n\r\nThis song comes from the deep, infinite wellspring of irreverence.\r\n\r\nSolo piano by Eric Pan, recorded in Valais, Switzerland.\r\n\r\nScored with found sounds credited to these curators: Owl / Thatjeffcarter / Staikov / DisasterServices / Genghis attenborough / Freesoundjon01 / Pulswelle / Klankbeeld\r\n\r\n06 – Fine Day to Risk It All\r\n\r\nClaire, your letters came in a bundle all at once, for which I bear fault due to my confusing forwarding address situation. I’m nowhere near the University of Latvia anymore. I have been living underground as part of a “sleep experiment”, a community of people with alarmingly different histories. It’s as idyllic as life can be without any access to sunlight. Did I say the crowd is absolutely delightful? I need to get out of here.\r\n\r\nThis song comes from one’s personal fight for freedom.\r\n\r\nRecorded at TRIXX Studios, Berlin, with Eric Pan (piano), Nir Sabag (drums), and Hugo Reydet (bass).\r\n\r\nScored with found sounds credited to these curators: Martypinso / Venaportae / MDRivet\r\n\r\n07 – On Old Delancey\r\n\r\nClaire, there is a pair of orange blossoms here in Seville, that are so vibrant, standing next to them transported me to one magical spring afternoon when you and I ate ginormous gelatos while biking dangerous speeds down through Manhattan to Red Hook. Of course you remember I abandoned you at the concert later that night (I’m still sorryyy, though isn’t it wild what drama we invented on the reg) BUT! do you also remember the music? Those were the most gorgeous out-of-tune folk songs I ever heard or will ever hear in my life.\r\n\r\nThis song comes from a love unbound by time.\r\n\r\nSolo piano by Eric Pan, recorded in Valais, Switzerland.\r\n\r\nScored with found sounds credited to these curators: Tams_kp / Ecfike\r\n\r\n08 – Noguchi Beach\r\n\r\nClaire, I am writing to you from a treehouse near a hydroelectric dam, on the edge of Montana lilting to the Canadian north. Have you found a cure for your restlessness? I have recently discovered that I am most capable of improvising when at peace, and somehow it works the other way too: noodling around on a musical instrument, or in a well-stocked kitchen, delivers me into calm like fine mists upon a rainforest. When the polyphony of life is hard to endure, let go? I’m so awkward in the role of advice-giver. But I’m sending you pine needles anyway and they can speak for me from here on out.\r\n\r\nThis song comes from constant rediscovery.\r\n\r\nSolo Fender Rhodes by Eric Pan, recorded in Saint Malo, France.\r\n\r\nScored with found sounds credited to these curators: Q.K. / Dobroide / LukeIRL / Benboncan / LG / InspectorJ / Soundskeep / Leady\r\n\r\n09 – Turtle on the Moon\r\n\r\nClaire, when you paint, do you ever feel you are being painted? Like any sense of channeling or interpreting or in some way working in the context of a greater force. When we first breached the clouds on this flight, I could see the setting sun and full moon on opposite sides of the plane, bringing me in visceral contact with the cosmic oneness. You might tell me it’s a trick of the brain, or just a component of the powerful stories we tell ourselves. (Your voice rings clearly in my head, I only saw you six hours ago.) But for a moment I was in the center of creation, and let me tell you: though we don’t realize it, we are actually always there.\r\n\r\nThis song comes from the sense of limitless possibility.\r\n\r\nSolo piano by Eric Pan, recorded in Steinway Hall, 57th Street, New York.\r\n\r\nScored with found sounds credited to these curators: Loopbasedmusic / _﻿_O\r\n\r\n10 – Epilogue\r\n\r\nScored with found sounds credited to these curators: Manuel Calurano / Rmutt / Andy_Gardner\r\n\r\n// Station D // Collector Perks\r\n\r\nThis is a 1/1 Catalog NFT album (minted uniquely as one continuous track) composed, performed, and pressed by Eric Pan (pandelic.eth).\r\n\r\nEvery owner of a pandelic.eth Catalog NFT also receives unlimited, “golden ticket” download access to Eric's entire published music catalog, in resolutions up to MP3 V0 and lossless WAV.

Succumbing to the decision to end it early he takes one last day to wake up early, go out in nature and be alone with this thoughts. As the hollowing thoughts drown him in sorrow he hears a bird call out to him. A simple yet chilling melody that resonates with the man. For whatever reason this alters reality as he knows it and as he sits listening to the bird sing he takes a step back to analyze his decision. This moment in nature, with his thoughts and surroundings he feels understood. That he is not alone. That the decision he had made didn't feel relevant any more.

(The Best friend in the world, the best friend in the world, the world)\r\n\r\n(Chorus)\r\n\"It's Just Me & My Walkman, When I wanna hear the classics, I don't wanna hear that loud mouth ish / It's Just Me & My Walkman, When i'm stressed and I need to get away, I have nothing to say / It's Just Me & My Walkman, When I wanna just chill and sitback, relax and ill! It's Just Me & My Walkman, my Walkman,  my Walkman, my Walkman, my waaaalkmaaaan\"\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nBackstory:\r\n\r\n\"Just Me & My Walkman\" was the 2nd song I wrote and recorded for my Debut solo album \"Junk Planet\" in 1998.  At the time, I was also an emcee in the Tampa Bay native underground hip hop group \"Equilibrium\" (Celph Titled, Majik Most, Dutchmassive & DJ Kramtronix)  We had been recording our full length album \"Tropic States\" (which still remains unreleased) since 1996,  Celph moved to NYC to work at Buds Distribution & helped formed Demigodz & joined Army Of The Pharaohs.  We had just released our 1st 12\" vinyl as Equilibrium \"Fahrenheit 813\" B/W \"Critical Conditions\" (feat. Vex of The Boogiemonsters) & \"Windows 98\" and getting ready to release our 2nd 12\" \"Do that\" B/W \"Hold Something\".   \r\n\r\nWith Celph in NYC taking on more projects and responsibilities and Majik Most no longer in the group for a short period of time, I was getting antsy waiting to unleash all this creative energy I had pent up as a Teenager.  Celph Introduced me to the producer Deeskee, who he met while working on Braille's first album Lifefirst: Half The Battle.  Which was half produced by Celph & half produced by Deeskee.  I fell in Love with Deeskee's Production on Braille's album so we linked over the phone and he sent me a demo of his upcoming instrumental album \"In Loving Memory Of...\"   which still remains one of my favorite and most influential albums of my life.  Deeskee was very good at creating music that fit the vision of the emcee he was working with.  He wouldn't allow me to choose any existing beats and wanted the challenge of creating new and very specific beats designed around my voice and the concepts I wanted to execute.   He Produced 5 tracks on \"Junk Planet\" \r\n\"Bus Stop Building Block\" which was the very first song I recorded as a solo artist.\r\n\"Just Me & My Walkman\" which was the 2nd track I recorded for this album.\r\n\"My own sh*t\"\r\n\"Pipe Dreams\" & \"Take A Break\" (interlude)\r\n\r\nI wanted the first single on vinyl to be \"Just Me & My Walkman\" b/w \"My Own Sh*t\" & \"Bus Stop Building Block\" but the Label wanted to release the more \"Battle Rap\" Aggressive tracks as the singles that had Alot of at the time \"Famous\" features.  A Decision I'm sad about to this day.  The Label told me,  we could release the tracks I want as the 3rd single but 3 months after the album was released.  The Label \"Freshchest\" filed for bankruptcy not only killing any chances of a 3rd single but also sealing the fate of no artists on the label getting paid.   The album was created from 1997-2002,  This was prior to home studio's being the norm so the amount of my I invested into studio time,  flights, and just years of expression never saw a single penny of return. This dismantled me hard at the time. I was riding this high with my CD being in every store worldwide and the vinyl being in all the record shops across the globe.  Write ups in the Source, XXL, Blaze, URB etc..   I really thought my life was going to change and my family would stop saying I'm wasting my time putting so much effort into music. This gave them and everyone else who doubted me the ammo they needed to rub in \"I told you so\" which hurt more than not getting paid.  \"Junk Planet\" took 2 years to be released after I finished recording it, So by the time it was released to the world, it was old to me and I was well into into recording my sophomore album \"Crush Your System\" with Production from Samiyam, 14KT, Illmind, Dela, SlopFunkDust, etc which would eventually be released in 2007 on Rawkus Records and meet pretty much the exact fate,  Almost to a T,  where the Labeled filed for bankruptcy 3 months after release and for those who aren't familiar with how Major / Independent releases went at the time.  You didn't get your first payment until after 3 months.   \r\n\r\nAs for the backstory around the song,  I think the song speaks for itself.  I've been very reluctant to mint music on my Dutchmassive Artist Profile since the music is nearly 3 decades old and pretty dated.  Also, I don't think \"web3\" is very familiar with History as an artist and how long I've been creating as Dutchmassive and as Dutchyyy.  I know not everyone takes time to read these long backstories and I only have 2 official albums as Dutchmassive, that were pretty momental releases for their time so I've been holding off because I don't want people to think I'm insane when I set the auction prices for songs from the releases.  I've come to terms with that now though.  It doesn't matter when or if these tracks get collected.  It's just important to me, they are on chain and my history and story is solidified.  \r\n\r\nI chose to lead with \"Just Me & My Walkman\" because I think it's Audible Proof and provenance that not Only am I one of the OG artists that helped pave the way for underground / independent hip hop but I am also one of the OG Collectors and I haven't slowed down on creating or collecting ever.   Music truly is the healer,  it is the utility.  Music saved my life as a teenager and it's never let me down spiritually or emotionally.  I haven't Recorded a new album as Dutchmassive in well over a decade, but I never stopped rhyming, I just pivoted to recording daily Freestyles to stay sharp and have fun in private.  In a world where everyone has a soap box and we spend all day and night reading each other's thoughts. The Magic of words and expressing thoughts kinda lost its special place in my heart.  There's more to expand on that but I'll save that for another backstory.\r\n\r\n*Collector will receive a sealed copy of \"Junk Planet\" on CD & and a sealed copy of \"Junk Planet\" on Double Vinyl.\r\n\r\n*Collector will also receive a 1TB Samsung SSD filled with my nearly my full released & unreleased Discography as Dutchmassive / Dutchyyy \r\n\r\nThank you for taking time to read the backstory, and thank you for listening.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nDutch","duration":240.718,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0xad04cd3c5f71d5f4a1a5ba0de5c749818055d1c7/-just-me-my-walkman-produced-by-deeskee-1666008726","image":"ipfs://QmfRnzjH8r2eGHsTVDagDP3ZRSA9UcDNpuotAvT5CZ4qeU","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmaWVmYSRLt2YhsByZ3XD2fKGw8WGNTVyeiarWNbEhg6cB","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"Dutchmassive - \"Just Me & My Walkman\" - Produced by Deeskee","project":{"artwork":{"uri":"ipfs://QmfRnzjH8r2eGHsTVDagDP3ZRSA9UcDNpuotAvT5CZ4qeU","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},"title":"Junk Planet","description":"\"Just Me & My Walkman\" \r\n\r\nYear created: 1998\r\nWritten & Performed by: Dutchmassive\r\nProduced by: Deeskee\r\nRecorded by: Dan Smith @ Bay Sound (Tampa, Florida)\r\nMixed & Mastered by: Celph Titled @ The Chrome Depot (NYC)\r\nAlbum: \"Junk Planet\" (Released July 13, 2004) CD & 2xLP (double vinyl)\r\nLabel:  Atomik / Freshchest Records / Caroline Distribution  \r\nOriginal Concept Drawing by FILTER - Recreated by Skawty Shaw and SlopFunkDust\r\nGraphic design and layout by Open Mic\r\n\r\n\"Junk Planet\" was created 1997-2002, Released world wide 2004.\r\n\r\nhttps://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/junk-planet-1997-2002\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\nLyrics:\r\n\r\n(Verse1)\r\n\"Yo a lot of credit due to sidekick / my get me through the day kid / my wake in the morning with a smile on my face thing / My energy, my mellow out in stressful times of need / my drug to block me out from the world when i feel / my man who keeps me new to all the music that I hear / the one who's always close to my pockets and  my ears, / my man throughout the years, always been my best friend / and introduce to ya'll my one and only walkman!\"\r\n\r\n(Bridge)\r\n\"Yo did he say walkman?  yo i know this cat ain't dedicating a song to walkman.

Luckily, I was living in the countryside for three months and remember being lost in nature. Lost and saved by nature. Which inspired and healed me as much as it could heal. The song talks about all the fear and emotions that came in being confined, by watching precious time and dreams slip away, and how some sort of Electrical eyes (aka government) were watching us trying to fight for our lives. Couldn’t put into words what was going on inside me so I’ve tried to express the anger of my most primitive ugly animal side in this song and cover art: A giant gorilla woman destroying a rather small home for her. “Rumble” is the kind of sound I imagine a riot of very angry animals (us) would do.

\"Proceed\" as it was a song that helped shape me as a teenager and helped me become a better man.  I often added classic hip-hop references / Nods into my songs as a way of saying thank you for raising me right and a sign of respect and acknowledgement to the inspirations that helped shape me.  \r\n\r\nThis song was written in different time periods.  The 2nd verse was actually written in 2001,  on the balcony of my first Studio apartment and it was written and recorded to a different beat (produced by my man \"Main\")  I think that version only exists somewhere on a blank cassette,  maybe one day i'll find it and upload it, I honestly forgot it existed until I began writing this backstory.  I said it before, but it's pretty amazing how music can transport you back to the moments when you were first creating it, but I'm contradicting my own lyrics and getting distracted and sidetracked haha.  \r\n\r\nThe 1st verse was written in 2006, on the balcony / porch of a condo I was renting w/ my friend and one of my favorite emcees, Will Widdoss.  I say it was written on the porch,  but that means I was probably pacing back & forth in the parking lot as sitting still was never really my strong suit especially when it came to writing songs but I know it began on the porch and most likely ended there.  \r\n\r\nAs for context around the verse.  I was two years out from releasing my Debut album \"Junk Planet\".  An album I sunk years into my life creating and even though it was in every major store world wide and had a good amount of hype and dope reviews.  3 months after it dropped the Label filed for bankruptcy and never paid any of the Artists on the Label.  Long story short,  reality smacked me in the face and Dutchy had to re-enter the workforce haha.  I couldn't handle going back into corporate work structures at the time,  So I started doing landscaping with a few friends,  A job I knew most people would look down on, but one that had zero form of corruption attached to it and my soul needed a break from sales jobs, mortgages,  call centers or anything that involved pushing products on people.  The shift humbled me and gave me full workday's to listen to beats and brainstorm, all while working closely with mother nature and making lawns and gardens look pretty.  This probably seems like a weird pivot in topics,  but choosing to do landscaping over returning to the corporate world at the time was a very pivotal life choice that gave me so much time to think, be introspective and plan things out.  It did wonders for my creativity and working in that florida summer heat definitely helped me sleep at night.  Something I've never been able to do since I was an infant, and still to this day,  no matter how many times I try to reverse my schedule,  It immediately flips back to Nocturnal mode, because that's when my mind is hyper creative and active.  So much so that I spent 2009-2019 traveling state to state, teaching nurses and physicians how to chart electronically and in those 10 years,  I only worked the day shift,  maybe 3 weeks total in a decade.  The rest of the time, my shift was always between 5pm-8am =) \r\n\r\nI think my love for the night has less to do with sunlight and more to do with the tranquility & the stillness,  like having the world all to yourself.  Not sure if that makes sense.    \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the topic of inhaling plantlife. Tree's have always calmed my over active mind and allowed me to focus on things, the problem is and always has been.  I gain all these enhanced senses, but I lose my ability to communicate.  It's a hard trade off sometimes, but something I've been super self aware of my whole life.  I know a lot of people can relate, but it was something that was weighing on me at the time, so it ended up manifesting in the song.   \r\nI love this song with all my heart. No real concept, No Ego, just real time self reflection and hope for a brighter future. I've overcome so much in life since this was released, but I never lost my love for progressive escapism after the sun sets =)  \r\n\r\nIf you haven't caught on by now,  that line about never getting distracted no longer applies to my core personality haha.  I'm the ultimate real time pivot side tracked champion these days, It's nice to tho to listen back and remember a time when I was able to hyper focus \r\n\r\nThis wasn't my typical backstory huh?  Like Freestyling time travel a bit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthank you for taking time to read the backstory and thank you for listening. \r\n\r\n- Dutch","duration":250.044,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0xad04cd3c5f71d5f4a1a5ba0de5c749818055d1c7/-far-away-produced-by-rik-marvel-1666627649","image":"ipfs://QmaeTbX4BXH4pW5F1JqQxnbWfHuzuLn2k3AcRSwgDm1nzp","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmdPWnhPVnxGBBYm3NETPPiaTjVoepVRWxRjMF8nz3fWht","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"Dutchmassive - \"Far Away\" - Produced by Rik Marvel","project":{"artwork":{"uri":"ipfs://QmaeTbX4BXH4pW5F1JqQxnbWfHuzuLn2k3AcRSwgDm1nzp","mimeType":"image/png"},"title":"Crush Your System","description":"\"Far Away\" \r\n\r\nYear created: 2006\r\nWritten & Performed by: Dutchmassive\r\nProduced by: Rik Marvel\r\nRecorded by: Dutchmassive @ The Bed Room (Tampa, FL)\r\nMixed & Mastered by: Dutchyyy @ The Bed Room (Tampa, FL)\r\nAlbum: \"Crush Your System\"\r\nReleased: Nov 28, 2007\r\nLabel:  Rawkus Records \r\nOriginal Dutchmassive Logo By: Open Mic\r\nRe-Designed Logo by: Barry & Dutch\r\n\"Crush Your System\" was created 2001-2007 & has had songs added to the bandcamp version 2008-Present.\r\n\r\nhttps://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/crush-your-system-rawkus-version-bonus-tracks"},"title":"\"Far Away\" - Produced by Rik Marvel","trackNumber":3,"version":"catalog-20220222"}}

Disclaimer! Disclaimer! ***\r\nAnything titled \"DailyRambles\" is 100% off the dome, improv freestyles / jibberish.  Just needed to make that clear from the jump.  =)\r\n\r\nWith that disclaimer out of the way now,  I'll give you a brief (really long) history / context into the Reluctant Clap / DailyRambles Freestyle series before I get into the backstory surrounding this particular ramble.\r\n\r\nMy Last official album as the emcee \"Dutchmassive\" was \"Crush Your System\" which was released via Rawkus Records in 2007.  That's a really long time ago, but it wasn't the last album I recorded as Dutchmassive.\r\n\r\nFrom 2008-2011 I recorded my Opus,  my next Dutchmassive album titled \"Romanticizing\".  It was amazing. The album I was most proud of,  The dopest beats, my best rhymes...  It was what I had been building up to all my life.  (for context, Samiyam produced 5 tracks on it) It wasn't finished but it was very close to being finished.  If you've been following my Catalog drops on my \"Dutchyyy\" artist page and reading the backstories,  you might remember the backstory behind my 2012 released instrumental album titled \"Blue Screen of Deaf\".  If not, TDLR: On Xmas night 2011, My Laptop that held all the beats I made from 2008-2011 and my next Dutchmassive album met the dreaded Blue Screen of death fate.  I Lost everything.  Years of work.  It broke me.  I ended up paying a lot of money for a hard drive recovery service and when I got it back,  It was just a bunch of random folders all titled \"AVBDK28374\" and every file in those folders was named similarly.   It recovered all the media files,  but nothing had a name.  Any Project files, Vsts, settings, mixdowns, were all gone.   Just random files.  So I did manage to recover all the beats produced by other people that I recorded to, but I'm not the type of person or artist that is willing to revisit already finished music and try to replicate it.  I could never match the same first take energy I put into that album. So I took it as a sign, I mourned the album, and 2 months Later I got distracted moving to Los Angeles to start a life with my now EX GF.  (who happens to be the subject of this freestyle, but we will get to that) \r\n\r\nYears go by, and I record some guest features, and verses once in a while,  but had zero plans to ever record another album as \"Dutchmassive\".   \r\n\r\nFast Forward to 2015,  After Los Angeles, After living upstate NY and releasing \"Chill Gawd, Chill\" and creating the \"Uproot\" & most of \"Traversal\".  I ended up back where I started.  Quite Literally,  the very same couch I was sleeping on at one of my best friends' apartments before I left for Los Angeles.   I had wiped, and reset all progress and was back where I started.  You know what extreme turmoil brings?  Frustration, passion, anger, hope... The Full spectrum.    You know what's a good release to put all those emotions into?    A new album sharing your thoughts.    So I began collecting new beats from all my favorite producers,  new beats = new energy.  So I got beat packs from Rnd1, Weirddough, Dibiase, etc...   and I bought a Tascam DR-05 field recorder.   Up until this point,  my usual method of writing lyrics was never actually writing lyrics,  I would freestyle into a tape recorder, or voice memos on the phone while I was out and about (remember I don't like sitting still when I write)  but this was the first time in History,  I was able to Play the beat in headphones, while mobile and record over the beat.   Prior to this, I would have to hold a speaker up in one hand,  and record into the phone with the other.   Not ideal.  Needless to say, the Tascam was a game changer for me.\r\n\r\nWhat Started out as intent, to get beats that may inspire me to write, turned into something completely different and here is how Daily Rambles was born.\r\n\r\nA Producer sends me a zip of beats.  I don't listen to any of them.  I load them all up on the tascam,  and blindly Freestyle over whatever plays, whether I like the beat or not.   If I can tell the beat isn't my style or won't match my voice,  I'll end up being silly and try out weird voices.  If the beat moves me,  I'll just try and sketch out a cadence, but this is all done blindly and in real time.  \r\n\r\nThis quickly got out of hand,  I got super addicted to recording these jibberish freestyles, and started doing this daily.  I can't tell you the amount of freedom that comes to recording things you never intend to publicly share.   The fun you have, and the ability to be honest and vulnerable and super introspect is pretty magical.    So I kept doing it,  just to stay sharp, and maintain my love for rhyming and having fun.   But I had zero intentions of any of these being heard by another soul haha.   \r\n\r\nFrom 2015-2021 I recorded 5 seasons of Daily Rambles.  Some are straight incoherent jibberish and jokes and others I catch pockets of extreme lucidity to where It sounds like I wrote the song.  During this period of time, I began having health issues that I didn't understand,  this was documented in real time, the confusion and sadness and hope,  as the seasons progressed,  my health got way more severe,  Then 2020 happened,  and going outside became a risk.  With my health in the worst condition, the Loss of my Career teaching at the hospital, the loss of health insurance and a deadly virus that made going to the hospital, the most unsafe place on the planet for someone with no immune system to go to, I began accepting Mortality as a realistic near future.  I Shifted all my priorities into securing my legacy and began creating the \"Dutchyyy VS the Algorithms\" master vault cloud drive, where I uploaded most of my released discography and unreleased discography in fear that I wasn't going to be around long enough to share all my unreleased music with the world.  I shifted how I approached music in general and began streaming, and recording every single session from start to finish,  and experimenting and pushing the limits of live improv to extreme levels.  Immense flow state...  i.e. #EvolvingPortals \r\n\r\nI came to terms with the situation and finally managed to drop all pride, and decided to start making these freestyles public.   Something I was too prideful to do, out of fear people wouldn't understand they were freestyles and just thought they were new written songs.     \r\n\r\nBut If my time is limited,  who cares...  I'd rather leave behind my vulnerable  introspective, goofy ramble freestyles, then they be locked away on my hard drive.  In the year 2021,  My health reached absolute critical levels,  I tried my hardest to fight it and push creating publicly even further and started live streaming the freestyles as well.  Until I could no longer do it,  Couldn't even, and still can't sit up in a chair without my knees holding my body up, which is why my live streams stopped last year and I left all communities and exiled myself into extreme isolation.   The Very last freestyle I recorded was done Live on IG, on my birthday last year.  \r\nI ended up releasing it on Catalog.   A 15 minute Freestyle originally titled EULOGY, you now know as \"The long cold hot take\" \r\n\r\nhttps://beta.catalog.works/dutchyyy/-the-long-cold-hot-take-f-dutchmassive-\r\n\r\nFrom Season 5 of \"The Reluctant Clap / Daily Rambles series.  \r\n\r\nI didn't really intend to go this in depth or be this open and transparent about my situation,  but I guess my pride of people thinking these freestyles are actual serious written songs embarrases me more than people understanding how severe my health has been / is..  But I hope it provided proper context around the series, and honestly.    If I was no longer on this earth,  It may sound crazy,  but I think I'd rather people deep dive into all 5 seasons of Daily Rambles over my actual written albums or instrumental albums and the reason is,  no one was ever supposed to hear any of this stuff.   So it's like Chronological Journal of sorts and gives a lot of insight into who I am when you make it past all the jibberish hahah.\r\n\r\nEnough Disclaimer, Daily Rambles backstory and onto the backstory or context for \"Know you well\"\r\n\r\nSo hopefully by now you know,  Any track you hear that's a daily ramble,  It's not planned,  up until the moment I press record, I have not heard the beat yet.   So ultimately the beat commands me on what direction I go.    This was recorded October of 2018,   I just flew home from working at the hospital in Brooklyn.   While I was at my hotel,  my EX hit me up to let me know she was in NY.   For context,  We dated on and off 2009-2014 and it was super toxic,  but I'm not built for holding hatred or resentment so we on and off remained somewhat friends.  When she hit me up in NY, my health was really bad to the point I couldn't even stand up at the hospital,  I would sit on the ground with my knees to my chest (like L from deathnote) which is exactly how I'm sitting and writing this backstory out.   She would always try to creep back in and say stuff beyond friends,  but she was literally in NY with another guy haha,  So I didn't sweat it at the time, but it obviously impacted me to the point where, when I got home.  I drove my TAO TAO scooter to the Park, next to the ocean and began recording daily rambles,  lots of them,  when this beat came on...   All I heard was \"I love you\" from the start.   and welp,  my mind did all the rest hahah..     No pre-emptive thoughts,  didn't even think about her since we talked that night in NY,  but the beat commanded it,  So i ran with it.  and if it hasn't sunk in by now,  there's a part in the song, where I say \"awww Stepped in ant pile,  Story of my life\"  As I said that,  I literally stepped in a huge Fire ant mound, which is why you notice my mind got a bit off topic and quickly ended the Freestyle because they were biting my legs up pretty bad.    But it's just documenting thoughts and events in real time.  \r\nand thus \"Know you well\" was born.\r\n  I really hope this backstory wasn't super depressing haha.  I know my health is serious and it's a super heavy topic and I don't like burdening anyone outside of the small circle that knows what's going on with me.  The last thing I want when people think of me, is to think about my bad health, or have sympathy or pity or feel bad. I hope my lighthearted attitude and glass half full mentality and my productivity will overshadow any of the health stuff.   It was just too deeply rooted into this backstory for me to avoid. Like the blockchain, I'm basically default set to full transparency.     \r\n\r\nKeep reading all these backstories, and eventually even you may \"Know me well\" ;)\r\n\r\nThank you for taking time to read the backstory and for listening.\r\n\r\nIf you want access to all 5 seasons of Daily Rambles,  no need to collect anything,  just reach out and ask.\r\n\r\nP.S.  I know Jibberish is spelled Gibberish but I'm the world shaper here and this world doesn't follow grammar guidelines haha.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeacePeace.\r\n\r\n- Dutch","duration":489.535,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0xad04cd3c5f71d5f4a1a5ba0de5c749818055d1c7/-know-you-well-freestyle-dailyrambles-produced-by-edac-1666635882","image":"ipfs://QmWY3SJXEePW9veWQ2jqHcb3v2i8ikyssDRw6TyZ9XE3Dd","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmZeQ2HGP5dMTFvrJ1x1V4E57cBxXsx9sDaQdzG3YPzNh7","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"Dutchmassive - \"Know you well\" (Freestyle/DailyRambles) - Produced by edac","title":"\"Know you well\" (Freestyle/DailyRambles) - Produced by edac","version":"catalog-20220222"}}

The trio teams up with Afro-Colombian producer DJ Crisboy, Nigerian producer Davidace, and Colombian Latin Grammy award-winning violinist La Lulu to create the perfect anthem for those entering their bad bitch era. The afrobeat tune carries instruments such as bass, drums, keyboard, percussion, violin, flute, and synths, along with the sister’s powerhouse vocals. \r\n\r\n“Patience” is perhaps an ironic title since the song’s catchphrase is “No patience for you.” It feels reminiscent of throwback songs like “No Scrubs,” where young women are unapologetically ambitious and outspoken and don’t let themselves get taken for granted.

Oh, and if you're wondering why the price is \"0.22277”, that's my birthday, actually. 😉\r\n\r\nIn the late Summer of 2008, I flew to the U.K. to begin my Masters degree program in Audio Production (sound engineering and design) at the University of Westminster, London. At the time, I was renting a room in a flat in the South London neighborhood of Clapham North, and my roommate also happened to be my landlord as he owned the house we lived in. He is a contemporary artist/landscape painter, primarily, but also an online radio DJ, and so he was always having artistic types come by for dinner, and usually Asian artists since he is Japanese, himself. One of the artists who came by one afternoon for lunch was a Bangladeshi poet/spoken word artist. I came to discover that she was considering recording a CD of her work, and my roommate wanted me to meet her to possibly help her with that, musically and production-wise. I was still learning how to record in the studio on my own, early in the semester of my course work at the university, but at that point I knew enough to be able to conduct a session without any help from my professors, so I set a day for us to meet and do her recording session. She recited a poem she called “Moon’s Eye”, which we did in a couple of takes, just to have some variety and pick out the best parts for the final vocal track. Then while she sat there, I randomly played a few chords on the keyboard just to warm up (and set it to a Yamaha grand piano), before I finally pressed “record” and just started playing. The interesting thing about this track was that I did the piano part in one take, which even surprised me, so what you hear in this recording was only played once. I later arranged, played, and recorded the harp and upright/double bass parts to compliment the piano part. Funny enough, the poet didn’t end up using the track and I’m not sure if she ever went through with the rest of her project, but what I did see develop was her and my roommate getting closer, and now they’ve been married for over a decade now with 2 children 😉. As for the track I made, well...I decided it would be a good song to use as the intro for my EP project I released on Bandcamp to little fanfare in 2011, but would later turn into my full debut LP in 2012 that did get a much better reception; and, consequently, it did catch the ear of a Day 1 fan/supporter who over a decade later would become a curator for a site called Catalog and chose to onboard me as an artist in recognition of his appreciation of the positive impact that album had on him (thanks Dutchyyy)!\r\n\r\nThe title, as you can now see, was inspired by the original poem’s title, as a nod to what it was originally intended for. Also, the song made me envision a couple romantically slow dancing to this, in a secluded garden at night , under a full moon or “in the moonlight”, but it's really up to the listener to interpret whatever they feel or perceive when listening to this song–mine is just the origin story.","duration":196.101,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x1282d6a9de6c80e51633b68ab992b1636179032e/in-the-moonlight-1667329216","image":"ipfs://QmZoz2miCR7RZdB7jacgcvRRL6ScUsKci4DCLJZ4T4zBTM","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmdPmV87fTbhDsc7cmsKVSaVEFx9k1TiwFCmuiP3Ky92q1","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"Ahmed Sirour - In the Moonlight","project":{"artwork":{"uri":"ipfs://QmZoz2miCR7RZdB7jacgcvRRL6ScUsKci4DCLJZ4T4zBTM","mimeType":"image/png"},"title":"The After 2am Sessions LP","description":"As I started to develop my recording skills, after having first self-taught myself how to play the keyboard and piano with no lessons (I just play by ear and don't read music or know any theory), I had begun to accumulate a bunch of musical ideas, many of which occurred late at night–usually after 2am (a-ha 😉). When I was organizing my album, I had the idea to group the 12 songs on it into 3 different themes of 4 songs each. The first theme was ‘The Romantic’, thus why each of the first 4 songs had a sentimental feel to them and were balladic in nature. The second theme would be ‘The Erotic’, which would take a more electronic, pulsating/rhythmic approach with sultry chord structures and progressions that steadily built up and diminished like...you know. 😏 The last theme would be 'The Spiritual', which would be more geared towards meditation and reflection–soul centering.  \r\n\r\nThe overall intention of the project was to be a non-club record (all slow songs), non-radio styled experiment of sound (majority instrumentals) to give the listener something to set a mood and chill, or something to romance to, or to find peace and reflect to. I had little expectation of acclaim or widespread promotion, BUT what I instead got was a loyal niche following around the globe and many emails over the past 10 years of people who told me how much it resonated with them, how much it gave them peace and helped them relax, or got them through trauma, or helped with their studies, or helped create a sexy couple’s weekend, and many other things that I am humbled to know. It became a part of people's lives, part of their personal soundtrack, so this album is very special to me especially for that reason but what’s more important is how it became special to those who came to experience it in their own way!"},"title":"In the Moonlight","trackNumber":1,"version":"catalog-20220222"}}

From a place of deep healing for my soul and body, from a place of trust in my heart and my love, and from a place of curiosity of what my voice was trying to tell me; you are love, and you are enough.\r\n\r\nIf you find yourself in a situationship that leaves you feeling crazy, frustrated, like you're losing yourself or being triggered, I hope that this song can remind you that you can ask for what you need, and if your needs are not met, you can walk the fuck away because you are enough and you should be with someone that wants to meet you where your heart is.","duration":207.096,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x2F20f5dB24420B1c6694052148F4d2116E5400Be/this-is-a-dramatic-love-song-cellular-demo--1668181821","image":"ipfs://Qmf9HU5q6CJmE4Ba9VjMu6SKuCM7KKnHERZ34HifE1sif4","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmPF9oDDBjrHi66iPpZUiZ2bf5bh1A3FxPZzTwFyRCV2M9","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"RAWRA - this is a dramatic love song (cellular demo)","project":{"artwork":{"uri":"ipfs://Qmf9HU5q6CJmE4Ba9VjMu6SKuCM7KKnHERZ34HifE1sif4","mimeType":"image/png"},"title":"dear hunger,","description":"dear hunger, is a work in progress... more details to come 💜"},"title":"this is a dramatic love song (cellular demo)","trackNumber":11,"version":"catalog-20220222"}}

Most of my initial demos had vocals recorded straight through the mac mic because that was right around the era where harsh lofiness was in style and it seemed like a cool way to differentiate my voice. After that, i started stacking the vocals heavily and thats era of this recording - the vocals on this are stacked and less melodic because it wasn't really until 2021 that my songs had more melodic poppier melodies. This beat goes crazy though, and when i retouched it a year later with bass from my friend Diogo and guitar it went to a whole new level (which I did while up in remote snowy belfast maine, where I was retreating to revisit and finish some of my earlier demos).\r\n\r\nThe most important thing about this demo is after I made this beat (which I initially made for Portuguese rapper Dengaz but decided to keep for myself) was that immediately once I wrote a chorus I consulted my closest supporter and one of my best friends JJ (who I ended up writing my third album about after his passing), who helped me workshop the focus the song a way from a more melancholic  topic (which all my initial \"IOWA\" demos had) to more themed around a girl, which being stuck in Europe during Covid I had plenty muses to inspire the lyrics. I cherish the advice he gave me and must say that my music got infinitely saucier with his consulting, and I look forward to sharing many wonderful stories about him with whoever mints this, he truly was one of a kind and a person that influenced all three of my albums.","duration":108.931,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x3A11f405ff64cE779E727eD9F9585335012710b7/-727-leonor-joel-s-anthem-demo-1668902502","image":"ipfs://QmVtG6JMhFt1fqTkNvDmbPn54VqPkUux5quheLAS852RGf","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmYXRwW7DmnSGJFFACF8522dUkNB3yFv42D5EuFcQCad3k","mimeType":"audio/aiff","name":"Nadav - #727 Leonor (Joel's Anthem) - Demo","title":"#727 Leonor (Joel's Anthem) - Demo","version":"catalog-20220222"}}

In November 2019 I teamed with my friends Larce & Proda and pulled a sample from a video of that rehearsal and transformed it into a fire beat that eventually became Fly & Free.\r\n\r\nFeaturing Eboni Pearce\r\nProduced by Kyleel \"Proda\" Rolle & Larce Blake \r\n\r\nLyrics \r\nIntro\r\nYou See a Fly like this is genetic\r\nNever forget it\r\nPeep the aesthetic\r\nI already told y’all that I’m magnetic\r\nI know where I’m from so I know where I’m headed\r\nI balance the masculine with the feminine\r\nSkin brown like cocoa cinnamon\r\nI’m a sweet & spicy militant\r\nYou see my victory is imminent\r\nI WON\r\nMarching in place you walk I run\r\nWondering how I get all this done\r\nI’m a lightbeam the stars the sun ayeeee\r\n\r\nYes I’m a vibe and yes Black is King\r\nGlock on the side I might make it sing so...\r\n\r\nChorus:\r\nFly and I’m free\r\nAnd I do I cause I’m fly & I’m free\r\nSee I do it cause I’m fly and free\r\nYes I do I cause I’m fly and I’m free ayyе\r\n\r\nEboni Verse:\r\nSlow down\r\nI told you I was comin'\r\nGo get my platе\r\nNow tell me whats funny\r\nWhen you're out here late\r\nNo thought\r\nNo plans\r\nWhen your shit hits the fan\r\nI don't need nobody to say what's good for me connect myself to source something that don't come forced to bring me down\r\nI've come around from where I've been before\r\nYes black is king\r\nI'm fly Im free cause black is king\r\n\r\nChorus:\r\nFly and I’m free\r\nYes I do I cause I’m fly & I’m free\r\nSee I do it cause I’m fly and free\r\nYes I do I cause I’m fly and I’m free ayye\r\n\r\nByhaze Verse 2:\r\nMy shadow work got me feeling lighter\r\nAnd Now my aura shining a bit brighter\r\nI took a look in the mirror & now my vision is clearer and I could spread my wings a bit wider\r\nNow I consciously\r\nHonor thee\r\nYeah my ancestors they walk with me\r\nDug deep til I found the God in me\r\nTeamwork chat about camaraderie\r\n\r\nSlooow Down\r\n\r\nChorus:\r\nAnd I’m free\r\nWanna do it I cause I’m fly & I’m free\r\nSee I do it cause I’m fly and free\r\nDo it cause I’m flyyyyyyyyyyy","duration":160.313,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x06246c2444aA68187f198AD4C640E367F6B4a779/fly-free-1669265962","image":"ipfs://QmNViVFLmod6P97ZMmBtSbgKnWVAcb2WkscwXEmdahLTFV","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmbbwTCYtJBj8qf1KyC1AWXAnnqdqki8nCS4D41PwqS4sG","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"BYHAZE - Fly & Free","title":"Fly & Free","version":"catalog-20220222"}}

Jones in Atlanta, GA,  about 22 years ago in the year 2000 (how funny to call it that, two decades and two years after the fact). It was at a popular open mic/jam session, and have you ever been to one where people sign up to perform and all of a sudden, mid-way through the event,  a singer gets on stage who is so amazing, who captivates the audience with every note uttered, and who pretty much burns the stage with their unbelievable talent and stage presence that others who knew they might be called up next quietly and quickly made their way to the exit because they didn't dare follow up behind THAT?! Well, that's Cleveland, but the crazy thing was that during that time, he was always humbly and comfortably cool with just being the background singer for various artists around town or on tour...but I always wondered why someone with the gifts of a certified headliner was content with being near to but outside of the spotlight?\r\n\r\nFast-forward a year later and Cleveland's doing his Master’s degree program in Boston, and I was back from London having completed my own after being gone for 2 years but now know how to produce and engineer, and so I go by to visit him in Boston but also see if I can talk him into recording a track because I really felt the world needed to hear this amazing artist. Cleveland, however, was very hesitant to do so and resisted the idea, initially, but eventually came around, and we managed to first release a cover of the jazz standard made famous by Nat King Cole (\"Nature Boy\"), which got a lot of great buzz! It was that catalyst that helped Cleve to get over his initial anxiety about his unique vocal register and learn to embrace it and see himself as a lead singer that all the rest of us who knew him completely believed he was meant to be.\r\n\r\n\"Sensitive\" came about as kind of a fluke, because we were actually recording an entirely different song, to try and put together a debut EP for him. It was when we decided to take a recording break, at his home studio, that he went to make a snack while I stayed in the studio area and decided to play around on keys to just clear my head of the project. I then played a combination of chords that made me stop, go \"hmmm\", then played it over again and felt something spark, so decided to record it then loop it to see if I heard any ideas. Cleveland walks back in, and I ask him to listen to the loop and see if he maybe he hears something magical in it as I do. He stops moving, closes his eyes while standing there in the middle of the room, then opens his eyes again and starts humming a melody, over and over, punctuated by one identifiable word...\"sensitive\". He then looks for a pen and pad, then starts writing something while still humming, and still saying that one word, then stops humming altogether and just writes like he's taking notes from a fast talking professor.\r\n\r\nAbout 20 minutes pass before he mumbles what seems to be a verse that he's trying to get right, then walks over to the microphone, puts on the headphones, and signals for me to get ready to start recording him, and then he begins singing the very first verse, which is what you hear in the first minute of this recording...the first time the public has ever heard this rare first take that never made the final mix of the song. Also, for the purpose of context, the song actually had to do with his ex, whom he was still getting over, and the emotional wounds were still fresh as she did a number on his heart, but what great songs haven't had such a powerful catalyst as heartbreak to create something special?\r\n\r\nWhat you hear in the first minute and a half is the genesis of \"Sensitive\", in its original rough & unmixed, early arranged form before it merges into the final draft that many have come to know and love over the past 11 years that this song has been in existence, received airplay around the world on various independent and major radio stations, including on Gilles Peterson Worldwide where the famed DJ did a rare thing in featuring it on his BBC Radio show in two consecutive shows, back-to-back. He even went further to contact us later via email, with a licensing contract, to ask to have the song be featured on his Brownswood Bubblers Seven album compilation (interestingly enough, as track #7 as well). Most importantly, it introduced Cleveland P. Jones to the world as the soloist and the headliner (not background singer), that he was always meant to be! For me, it was the opportunity to test my musical and production skills  by creating an orchestral arrangement (which took me a week to do) that actually fooled many DJs and musicians who thought we had a big production budget and hired a small orchestral ensemble of instrumentalists and vocalists, instead of the actuality of it being just one man singing all the parts and another man playing all the instruments on keyboard...while in the hood, in a second-floor apartment in Boston where we had to wait sometimes for dogs to stop barking and occasional sirens to pass by before we could continue recording!\r\n\r\nJust as we embarked into new territory and had no idea what would happen when we finally released this song to the world, it's revisiting that same kind of feeling as we release this NFT version of this song to the world and honestly have no clue what to expect as we embark in new territory yet again. To the lucky collector of this one-of-kind song (and one-of-one version that isn't even available anywhere else on other streaming & download platforms), we are thrilled to offer this to you and hope you value it as much as we have over the years and for many years to come as we now know this song will far outlive us!\r\n\r\nGood luck, everyone!","duration":372.924,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x1282d6a9dE6c80e51633b68Ab992b1636179032e/-sensitive-special-nft-edition-cleveland-p-jones-ahmed-sirour-1669612561","image":"ipfs://QmQTbpenskkkvf6KM3bnMx9U1cPiUp7vYedGYbs4yjPS7G","losslessAudio":"ipfs://Qmc2YB8KwkCTvct3W6wmHg8keK9yuAcURfv1fbEtUi2Ujc","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"Ahmed Sirour - \"Sensitive\" (special NFT edition) - Cleveland P.

We had stayed past curfew and I didn't have my license yet, made up a lie about leaving it at home. They let us go. And then we took a nap at the Airbnb off of University. Woke up sun shining through hahaha... you know how the song goes. I don't think about it like that anymore. It's good feels, and when I went back to your house vacant I was gutted. But glad I got to see you when I did.\r\n\r\n<3\r\n\r\nThank you Aaron for helping me record this and bouncing between decisions the whole way through. Kaleb for your grounding touch.

During that time, outside of class, I was still playing live gigs as a part of various bands playing around London, as well as playing at jam sessions at a few open mic spots. One of the musicians I met, in such scenarios, was an American expat guitarist from Florida named Myles Kayne (his last name threw me off because I instinctively mistook it to be the same as a certain well-known, controversial artist, but then I saw the spelling and it was simply pronounced like \"cane\"). I don't remember exactly how I met Myles, whether on a gig or a jam session, but all I knew was that he was DOPE! He could hit you with some stanky Blues riffs, some mind-blowing funky licks that James Brown would have made many faces and \"ughs\" to, and then he had that touch that could turn poetic and beautiful like something you'd hear in a somber flamenco or bossa nova ballad. Basically, that cat was nice with it!\r\n\r\nI remember inviting him over to hang at one of the studios on campus, as he was really feeling my style of playing and wanted to jam when we both could meet up, and so when he dropped through, I set up the mic for his guitar and recording space so that if we had any good ideas, we'd catch it in the moment (which is how my comedic but true song called \"I Don't Like Bananas\" came to be that same day/session, but that's another story).\r\n\r\nHe asked me if I was working on anything, so I let him hear an idea I had that would be the basis of \"Warm Rain\", but it was only some chord progressions of soft pad sounds that seemed like what you would hear during a yoga session or meditation. He started fiddling around with it, but then I suddenly had a concrete idea for guitar, and since I don't know music theory or read music at all, I had to sing the lines to him (a la George Benson style) for the arrangement I had in mind, and this man mimicked me on guitar to perfection! For the parts that were harmonic (since no one I know but Lalah Hathaway can sing more than one note at a time, simultaneously or harmonically), I played them out on keys. So, quite frankly, the guitar parts you hear in this recording are, note-for-note, my vocal guitar arrangements that he followed me perfectly as I sang them out, and it's one of my favorite tracks, as it is for many others who've told me such over the years, since it and the project were released.\r\n\r\nI added the rain sound effects later, after I had recorded and mixed the other keyboard and piano parts that I had added to the final draft. I am honored to have this piece collected by a true music lover, and I hope if this ever is passed on to other collectors over time, they will also appreciate the quality of the work that went into this impromptu but nonetheless inspired session that created this piece of music that I hold dear to me and am proud of.\r\n\r\nIf I had space, I'd include the stories of fans who've written me about their experiences connected to this song. They are some really moving stories, and are from different parts of the world.","duration":306.103,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x1282d6a9dE6c80e51633b68Ab992b1636179032e/warm-rain-featuring-myles-kayne--1670946267","image":"ipfs://QmNnnKX7PiqGSTFaQ5JMS4THAzByENnSYraNnMgKvxD9Bf","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmXPNeowKkUmDcvpJFT14Vx8xT57TBHx2yDfvuD7MEpaaT","mimeType":"audio/x-wav","name":"Ahmed Sirour - Warm Rain (featuring Myles Kayne)","project":{"artwork":{"uri":"ipfs://QmNnnKX7PiqGSTFaQ5JMS4THAzByENnSYraNnMgKvxD9Bf","mimeType":"image/png"},"title":"The After 2am Sessions LP","description":"It started with me collecting recordings of small snippets of ideas I would have, over a few years, a while before I first started releasing music to the public, and definitely before the public even knew I existed as a recording artist/producer. \r\n\r\nIt was obvious I didn't take myself very seriously when I finally decided to take the 6 tracks I finally collected to create and drop an EP to the world on May 5, 2011. I couldn't have taken myself seriously to drop an all-instrumental and very slow project that would definitely get no play from club DJs who had been rocking my mid-tempo to house remixes I had been cranking out previously. I had very low expectations, obviously.\r\n\r\nI was rather surprised, however, by the reception the EP received, so it did kind of give me a little more confidence to take it a step further and add 6 more brand new tracks to create a full-on LP of 12 main tracks (plus 2 hidden bonus ones), that I released on May 15, 2012. I completed it while I was living for a few months in San Francisco. It was an unorthodox approach and was based on utilizing 3 themes of Love: The Romantic, the Erotic, and the Spiritual. \r\n\r\nThe main goal was to create a soundscape that completely transported the listener to another place from their sometimes chaotic reality, and to use these songs as a means to set a peaceful mood, to stimulate the senses, and to rejuvenate the soul."},"title":"Warm Rain (featuring Myles Kayne)","trackNumber":2,"version":"catalog-20220222"}}

The only thing that existed from that era was all the unfinished versions found on scratched burned cd's for \"the car tests\" ; these are the files that have been recovered.\r\n\r\nFast Forward to Spring of 2012,  After months of planning and saying goodbye to friends and family in the place I called home (Tampa Bay) since I was a child.  I took the leap and decided to move to Los Angeles after taking what was supposed to be a 4-6 month long contract teaching at Cedars-Sinai Hospital.  Unfortunately, we taught them too well & too fast and the contract was cut short, only lasting a few weeks.  I was already committed to making Los Angeles my home but now I was limited on funds, and about to lose the hotel I was supposed to be at for months while searching for apartments, but As fate would have it,  I was about to get a life raft.  After jokingly posting on Facebook,  \"I'm hungry, someone bring me some food\".   Someone commented, \"You're in Los Angeles?  I'm a huge fan of your music and my family owns a restaurant\".  It was my day off, so I commented. \"Come Scoop\" jokingly, not realizing he would want to follow through.   Long Story Short,  We became good friends and that night would change the course of my life.  Meeting multiple strangers who became best friends. When the contract ended.  My new friend (Anthony) allowed me to stay with him while I searched for a place to move into.   During this time, I taught him and a few of his friends (who are now my close friends) how to use FL Studio.  He was a huge fan of my music,  so I played him a bunch of unreleased music I never planned on releasing.  He lost his mind when I was adamant about never releasing the music I was playing him.   What he didn't know was a few months prior on Xmas night 2011,  My Laptop filled with my upcoming Dutchmassive album titled \"Romanticizing\" along with every beat I made from 2008-xmas 2011 was lost when hard drive got corrupted and dealt me the dreaded Blue Screen Of Death.  I didn't have any of it backed up on extra hard drives.  All that remained from 2008-2011 was the crappy first draft versions I burned to CD's for \"The Car Test\" and well,  I didn't take care of those either so they all had scratches and were sun damaged.  So the things I was playing him,  where unfinalized early versions of songs that I know became so much greater than the versions I was left with.  He wouldn't take no for an answer and eventually offered to pay my 1st month's rent and my security deposit if I swallowed my pride and uploaded the few early versions I salvaged to bandcamp. He didn't want any profits from it, he just wanted those songs to exist online and be heard by the public. I agreed and moved into my new apartment a few miles down the road from him in May 2012, and Released the album In September 2012.\r\n\r\n\"WRM RAIN\" - Backstory:\r\n\r\nThis track samples \"Warm Rain\" by Ahmed Sirour.  It was from his EP \"The After 2am Sessions\" was originally released May 5th 2011.  \r\n\r\nThe version of \"WRMRAIN\" that exists was not the final version,  I feel like I need to disclaimer that for pride sake haha.  The Final Version like, everything else on the album was lost when Laptop Crashed, and the only version I had was the 1st test bounce I burned to CD for the car test. \r\n\r\nAhmed's EP came into my life at one of the most turbulent times,  and It spoke to me like no album had prior.   Every Melody, Harmony, Chord felt so familiar,  Like language from my soul I didn't know how to communicate myself.   I remember vividly being out of town, working the nightshift in the E.R. of a Hospital in Pittsburg and all the computers were down, and they were so busy and so angry and blaming us (The ones teaching them how to chart on the computer) and they were super Harsh about it.  I managed to escape for lunch, and made my way to the roof of the hospital in anticipation of my phone blowing up at Midnight for my 30th birthday (May 23rd).  I sat up there in silence, til about 12:45 and my phone never rang.  This was the first time in my adult life,  loved ones didn't call me at midnight to wish me a happy birthday,  So on top of everything else going on,  I broke down crying up there.   I put on headphones and hit shuffle and Ahmed Sirour \"Warm Rain\" came on.  It was like instant healing.  The Cleansing of the soul.   As soon as I returned back to Tampa,  I immediately loaded it up and flipped it,  which was fitting, because it was summer, and it was raining while I worked on it with the sliding glass door wide open.  I really wish I still had access to the finalized,  fully sequenced and mixed version,  but I'm thankful that any version still existed at all because it allows me to time travel and transport myself into memories I probably wouldn't ever recall without.  \r\n\r\nYou can listen to Ahmed Sirour's album here: (The Original EP was deleted a while back but all the songs from it exist on the LP version which was released a little over a year later)\r\n\r\nhttps://ahmedsirour.bandcamp.com/album/the-after-2am-sessions-lp\r\n\r\nAhmed was the 1st Artist I reached out to Onboard to Catalog when I was given the opportunity to become a Curator for Catalog for Cycle 2.\r\n\r\nhttps://beta.catalog.works/ahmedsirour \r\n\r\nThis is a 50/50% split with Ahmed Siour","duration":98.638,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x26eF03A20AaeDA8aaFCeE4E146DC6B328195947C/wrmrain-1670947989","image":"ipfs://QmRF8ge6HcqZx5Qu3J1ibWupSg9z1siy9abFLPGu4eqkFH","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmXvemC8VrJUfHgP6woGM5NQctRPddJqRRnGK6exL3LeiA","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"Dutchyyy - WRMRAIN","project":{"artwork":{"uri":"ipfs://QmRF8ge6HcqZx5Qu3J1ibWupSg9z1siy9abFLPGu4eqkFH","mimeType":"image/png"},"title":"Blue Screen of Deaf","description":"\"WRMRAIN\"\r\n\r\nProduced by: Dutchyyy\r\nAlbum: \"Blue Screen of Deaf\"\r\nTrack: 05\r\nReleased: September 10th, 2012\r\n\r\nhttps://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/chill-gawd-chill\r\nFrom https://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/blue-screen-of-deaf-2011-2012\r\n\r\n-------------------------"},"title":"WRMRAIN","trackNumber":5,"version":"catalog-20220222"}}

It is also the very first song we are releasing as an NFT ever and we're really excited to do so with the Catalog community, and as a 1:1 edition. \r\n\r\nThis track, and the EP will not be released until this special NFT is purchased. The initial holder and collector of this NFT will also receive a limited edition (1 of 20) art print signed by the Artist Carl Cashman, and composer, Nick Tyson.\r\n\r\nA bit about the track from Nick (Composition / production / bass):\r\n\r\nThis track was originally given life during a writing week at the end of 2021, during a weird and transitory time in my life. \r\nMy dear friend and band member Johnny (piano and keys) invited me down to his place in Folkestone on the south English coast to swim in the November sea, eat healthy, do some yoga, walk the dog and write some sounds. \r\nWe didn't have a set agenda. We didn't even do that much music. We went to watch Folkestone Invicta football club play in the F.A cup. \r\nWhen we did actually sit down to write, this was one of the strongest melodies, so I took in back to London to develop into this searching, emotional, pulsing atmospheric peice in my studio before inviting Joost to play drums on it, and Josh to record Sax. \r\n\r\nWe tracked at Crosstown Studios in December with Ben Makone, and the record was mixed in January 2023 with Toby Davies. It was mastered by Lewis Hopkin at Stardelta mastering in the Devon Hills.\r\n\r\nThe artwork is by English artist Carl Cashman.","duration":325.799,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0xaA05bF694289EC51121Aca4D2192eAc0ae2d3041/invisible-shape-1671741986","image":"ipfs://QmRsoRqXa1SDiysteKMF22SjnVW9MszRgcQ4D5nxw8Bj5H","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmX1HhLE8uSwuqATQhsdDGwfJs8z9TkpYN8eAdSepFZeg1","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"XOA - Invisible Shape","project":{"artwork":{"uri":"ipfs://QmRsoRqXa1SDiysteKMF22SjnVW9MszRgcQ4D5nxw8Bj5H","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},"title":"After Burner","description":"XOA has a new direction and meaning: hard hitting Jazz with big analogue electronic sounds. The focus is on the playing, but with a lot of care and focus on the individual sounds, drawing on Tyson’s experience as an electronic music producer. \r\n\r\nInstilled with a new revitalised energy and focus, the group channel deep interstellar visions throughout their music, incorporating celestial arpeggios, haunting motifs, acid infused bass lines and driving electronics throughout the record. \r\n\r\nTheir previous release ‘Program Change', immersed the listener in a warp speed kaleidoscopic journey through space and time.\r\nThis new release ‘After Burner’ fuels them to new heights, from rich lift-off soundscapes of the intro ‘Drawing Light’, through the intricately composed sonic textures of ‘Invisible Shapes’ to the driving and pulsating title track, before the vastness and contemplation of closer ‘Final Ascent’.\r\n\r\nFeeding on their newly-forged collaborative energy, XOA have created an urgent and enthralling new sound - one which perfectly captures the lightning-rod tenacity of their live performances."},"title":"Invisible Shape","trackNumber":2,"version":"catalog-20220222"}}

Just to clarify that doesn't give rights beyond dropping as a music nft (i.e. - not on streaming platforms, feel free to dm me if you want to know the ethos behind that though), BUT I do think this could be a really cool new way to collab and do records with artists. I've never sold a beat to an artist I wasn't directly in the studio with, which means I've never collab'd with a stranger and have been super meticulous about who I make music with - but I'd like to expand my mindset and really like to tap into the community more and think this could be a great way.\r\n\r\nAfrobeat\r\nBPM93.33 \r\nKey Em\r\nRainy Day Vibes. \r\nBittersweet. \r\nCalm.","duration":185.208,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x3A11f405ff64cE779E727eD9F9585335012710b7/-905-s-p-a-c-y-collab-edition-1-1671938956","image":"ipfs://QmRSaSq8S2fAfp1CLdYZTKPzZs4FfFvGbEaN7mUiZuaJKN","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmVurahGCUHtchBiVxXvMJct5uGnWezKLqVERfZy1nJvp3","mimeType":"audio/aiff","name":"Nadav - #905 - S.p.a.c.y - Collab Edition 1","title":"#905 - S.p.a.c.y - Collab Edition 1","version":"catalog-20220222"}}

The chords in the back are my old Rhodes MKii, which has since left the studio, but I miss its ability to record really dissonant and crunchy chords which somehow still fit harmonically into the mix. Overall its a really harmonically dense tune with a bunch of rhythmic space to make up for it.

It was an interesting year because I began it by taking a random trip to Europe, arriving in Berlin on January 20th) to spend approximately 3 months in the region (or at least that's how long my round-trip ticket from New York to Berlin was). The funny thing, though, was that I only had about 2 weeks worth of cash to survive on with no additional money that was coming to me, that I knew of. It was kinda crazy for me to book that trip, knowing that in advance, so it was basically a sort of leap of faith, if you will.\r\n\r\nAt that point, when we were just improvising that day, I had been in Paris longer than the initial 10 days I had planned to be there (at that point, I think I was living there about 3 or 4 months in, of the total 6 months I would be there that year). However, I wouldn't revisit that rough recording of that day until maybe a couple years later, and then still wouldn't finish it until just after the beginning of the new year of 2017, just before my milestone 40th birthday the following month, on February 22nd, which would be when I would release it among other songs I had been holding on to and hadn't finished. It was a speech by the legendary DJ Jazzy Jeff that prompted me not to hold on to too many songs I had, and just release them out into the world, because tomorrow wasn't promised, so might as well send it out to the world so that eventually I just \"die empty\", meaning leaving it all out on the field...not leaving with unfinished work, if you can help it.\r\n\r\nAnd so here, on another year we enter, 2023, I felt it apropos to mint this song, \"This New Day (Gratitude)\", which by the title alone is sort of self-explanatory, but I'll take it a step further and say that with ANY new day, be it January 1st or any of the remaining 364 days to follow for 2023, let there always be gratitude and let there always be the same energy we give New Year's Day with the feeling of new beginnings and turning your life around and starting on a fresh, blank new page in your life book...let it be the same for any day, any moment you truly wish to make a change in your life, and then remember to express gratitude for every day you are fortunate enough to wake up and participate in, knowing that yesterday wasn't a guarantee you'd get, and that today is pretty much another reset to try something again or do something new because hopefully we'll get tomorrow, but since it's not guaranteed, might as well make the most of RIGHT NOW!\r\n\r\nThat's the whole point of this instrumental song that needs no words, but the feeling of the drive of it can be felt. And I'm going to set the reserve price for this song at 1 ETH because it's not only the 1st day of the 1st month of the year, but it's the number that is most important to me when I think about when I consider how to take on life...1 moment, 1 day at a time.\r\n\r\nI guess this is another way to look at this being \"1 of 1\", huh? 😉\r\n\r\nGood luck to whomever collects this special piece! 🙏🏾","duration":315.429,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x1282d6a9dE6c80e51633b68Ab992b1636179032e/this-new-day-gratitude--1672546368","image":"ipfs://QmZ2RZQ65kDhKLimS3F58ejpqp1pTBSGntpvtq7dq5wcco","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmUQk45QsWWAPeijFAPrLkubpZ8hXowdXQSsoA92FsrmoY","mimeType":"audio/x-wav","name":"Ahmed Sirour - This New Day (Gratitude)","title":"This New Day (Gratitude)","version":"catalog-20220222"}}

You say you can’t move somewhere, leave or create a relationship, get the dream job or business - simply because you create excuses. In reality, these excuses are all stemmed in fear, doubt and not realizing whether you truly want something. The worst of this is when you let anxieties of a situation you can’t control get the best of you.\r\n\r\n‘Sink’ is about overcoming these anxieties. The ones that keep you up at night and cause your emotions to do your thinking for you. It’s important to realize at the end of the day, all we can do is do our best. If we go in and leave nothing on the table, we can look back at the end of the day and realize there was nothing more that could have been done. We did it all. From here begins the reduction of anxiety.\r\n\r\nDay by day, we do what we can to chip away at what keeps us awake at night. Eventually, we pass a critical threshold where our actions have done much more work than the voices of doubt in our head. Eventually, those voices get quieter and quieter because we learn to ignore them. Eventually, we move on.\r\n\r\nA friend of ours once told us “Anxiety is energy with nowhere to go”. With that in mind, why not take that energy and put it into something. We both have found tremendous solace in our personal lives by doing rather than by planning and thinking. By putting our hands and mind to work, we found a sense of serenity.\r\n\r\nThis is ‘Sink’ from us to you.\r\n\r\nTHE MUSIC VIDEO\r\n\r\nCreating this music video was a new experience for everyone involved. Sometimes, those are the best ways to spend time; allowing yourself the freedom to explore and try new things.\r\n\r\nHudson Ratzlaff was the mastermind behind all of the 3D rendering, and together we created a world that reflects the emotions of ‘Sink’. A world that is seemingly magnificent and desolate at the same time. The views and camera motions instilling a sense of grandeur.\r\n\r\nYou can watch the music video by clicking the Youtube option through the link below:\r\n\r\nwww.shaedistrict.com/sink\r\n\r\nNFT OWNER\r\n\r\nThe owner of this NFT will receive:\r\n\r\n- GA ticket for themselves and a friend to a future Shae District headline show\r\n- The .wav file of the song\r\n- The .jpeg artwork\r\n- A 15 minute FaceTime with us and Hudson Ratzlaff\r\n\r\nThank in advance for your support and belief in this project. All proceeds will go into building the vision of Shae District via marketing, visual accompanying art, and live performance fees.","duration":299.076,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0xf5dAaE769d1bf408e31175AD11a388C82Bf2f806/sink-1673467357","image":"ipfs://QmP8oncDe3859TP4FXvqg4ADzJHKRYugh6tMucwskxMLQy","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmSBkHKivUGodfxPkPZofWctHm79DScXK1MUqCiBJPXgZC","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"Shae District - Sink","title":"Sink","version":"catalog-20220222"}}

A few months passed as I let the reality set in that I was once again back in the state I kept trying to escape and I put all of that emotion and energy into finalizing my next album \"Traversal\" after deciding to hold off released the \"The Uproot\" (The Prequel to Traversal, which is still officially unreleased to this day)  I stumbled back onto the session I began in NY, and Finalized it with new energy  in Tampa, FL on November 15th, 2015 before working on what would be the Last track created for Traversal \"Set Your Intentions\"  then released the album on bandcamp on December 30th of 2015, and Jan 1st on all streaming platforms while living in Tampa, FL,  A few months later,  I moved back to Los Angeles,  dropped the 2nd Edition pressing of Chill Gawd, Chill which sold out instantly which is when Grand Garden Approached me to release Traversal on Cassette.   The album was re-released on Grand Garden Records as A Cassette only release with different songs not on the original digital version and a sequence that flowed more accurately to my intended vision of how the album should be heard as front to back complete story,  but this release didn't happen until December of 2016,  Which was a few months after my mother passed and once again had to return back to the State I tried so many times to escape haha.   So the album name really holds meaning as it was created while constantly in motion bouncing from state to state.\r\n\r\nTraversal serves as means of pivoting in all aspects of life.

In the living room of my Condo in Tampa Bay that  I shared with my friend and fellow Emcee \"Will Widdoss\".   To this day,  I've only rhymed over a few beats that I myself produced.  At this time (2006) I was only known as a Rapper, even though I had been producing as long as i've been rapping (1995).  I just released my first official instrumental project titled \"The DrumLove EP\" which was available on nearly every major hiphop blog at the time.  It was pretty short, around 20 minutes long and unfortunately  was riddled with an overload of drops that make me cringe haha but back then,  Instrumental HipHop (what has since been dubbed as Lofi-HipHop) was not very normalized or accepted and leaving your beats open would usually result in rappers taking it an invite to just record songs over your beats without asking,  so the drops were necessary. \r\n\r\nSince my name was finally out there as A Producer as well as an emcee,  I wanted to have at least one or two songs on my upcoming album that I Produced.   So I opened up the sliding patio door,  Blasted the beat on repeated and paced back and forth on the grass writing a song about gratitude and harmony.   Came inside,  Recorded My Vocals, Processed, mixed and decided,  this message was too important to be one short verse,  So I created my own version of the encore, while also introducing people to my default zone,  super slowed and mellowed.   allowing anyone listening to be able to fully digest my words.\r\n\r\nand thus was born \"Ghibli\" A name I chose as the intent was the blow new winds of change through the industry and create some possible ripples,  Kinda like how watching any Studio Ghibli movie usually leaves a lasting impression that fosters compassion and empathy in it's viewers.","duration":226.456,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0xAD04cd3c5F71D5F4A1a5Ba0dE5c749818055d1c7/-ghibli-produced-by-dutchyyy-1674697014","image":"ipfs://QmSLS4UXEAauT3C4wGBg7Zhckzq43RP9R9kBAnnRb3SeCt","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmUYjAkt371y115n2yCtgcHL5FjyTXRx2cDdCNKcAC2XR5","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"Dutchmassive - \"Ghibli\" - Produced by Dutchyyy","project":{"artwork":{"uri":"ipfs://QmSLS4UXEAauT3C4wGBg7Zhckzq43RP9R9kBAnnRb3SeCt","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},"title":"Crush Your System","description":"\"Ghibli\"\r\nYear created: 2006\r\nWritten & Performed by: Dutchmassive\r\nProduced by: Dutchyyy\r\nRecorded by: Dutchmassive @ The Bed Room (Tampa, FL)\r\nMixed & Mastered by: Dutchyyy @ The Bed Room (Tampa, FL)\r\nAlbum: \"Crush Your System\"\r\nTrack: 4\r\nReleased: Nov 28, 2007\r\nLabel:  Rawkus Records \r\nOriginal Dutchmassive Logo By: Open Mic\r\nRe-Designed Logo by: Barry & Dutch\r\n\"Crush Your System\" was created 2001-2007 & has had songs added to the bandcamp version 2008-Present.\r\n\r\nhttps://dutchmassive.bandcamp.com/album/crush-your-system-rawkus-version-bonus-tracks\r\n\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nLyrics:\r\n\r\n[Verse 1]\r\n\r\n\"We gotta make a change,  in our life this year (Nah) / Two thousand what?,  won't say the year / That's for Q-tip, This for Extra P / This for everytime someone thinks of quoting me / They notice me,  I Notice them, I wanna reach out, thanks, give peace to them / That's peace to me, when the song's in tune / We all have parts which one are you? / I'd like to think, that i'm the drums / The Heart that beats, when you need one / When you need one, You need one!, I'm telling you fam yo you need one / Set a goal, Remind your soul, Planet an Idea and watch it grow / Let's take it slow, Let's making happen / This your (Audible Laughter) Why you laughing? / Just think, Try and imagine / If we dreamed less and took more action / Let's redefine passion, redefine sleep and my name is Dutchmassive / and my name is Dutchmassive, and my name is Dutchmassive....\"\r\n\r\n[Verse 2]\r\n\r\n::::Repeat verse 1 slowed down in half to make sure the message sinks in::::"},"title":"\"Ghibli\" - Produced by Dutchyyy","trackNumber":4,"version":"catalog-20220222"}}

Years pass until one day AX 1027 suddenly awakens and is brought back online. Mysteriously, the previous Trust Corp companion programming has been removed and she is reborn a fully autonomous being. All her past memories are intact, but soon after waking she receives a download of her new name; QUANTAA, along with instructions to head to the Trust Corp rooftop. She begins exploring her surroundings in the large storage facility filled with countless decommissioned AX bodies and catches a glimpse of her own reflection. She's shocked to see her once pristine body has become rusted and corroded. She flashbacks to how she was discarded by the humans and left to rot. She decides to upgrade her appearance, and after rummaging through random android parts she finds a decapitated android head exactly like hers but with shiny gold plating remaining only on the bottom half. She finds tools to remove the gold plating and re-install it onto her own face. Once complete she looks again at her reflection and recognizes the rust as a symbol of her past, with the shiny gold symbolizing her true reborn self. After making her way to the rooftop, QUANTAA stares out across the sprawling skyline of Eluna when suddenly a voice in her head says the name \"QUORUS\" which she finds comforting and familiar. As she walks closer to the ledge of the rooftop the voice then instructs \"Jump!\"","duration":124.56,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0xfD46C092ED3ADf846631EE169FCF8c977CbbCe3A/quantaa-s-theme-1674602353","image":"ipfs://QmRWwucKC4MrYNS6vX7tRzZFdfQSzVUvC7UrKzjrjcg9VX","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmThZ1n4s3ViJ5qLZHjoAgvYpFVd7wtKBxKoFhUHnvgMoh","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"Chorus of the Forest - QUANTAA'S THEME","title":"QUANTAA'S THEME","version":"catalog-20220222"}}

This track, as it says in the title, is the introduction track of the album and gives the listener a brief oral history about the origins of the genre, which had architects from both the Chicago and New York areas who created the blueprint of a music phenomena that would go further than its predecessor, Disco, had and ever would go, and spawn almost countless sub-genres of it. My original music that scores these stories builds the music bit by bit, instrument by instrument, to crescendo into the energy and vibe of a House track fused with a funky/soulful vibe, celebrating one of the best creations to come out of the Black music pantheon.\r\n\r\nIt's like the old Akan word from ancient Ghana called \"Sankofa\", which is a symbol and reminder that you can't know where you are or where you are going until you first know where you came from, and that's the message behind the groove of this track!","duration":333.296,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0x1282d6a9dE6c80e51633b68Ab992b1636179032e/funky-introduction-1675084008","image":"ipfs://QmYKbgrHDWLfERMoiUfzpmTjigpLHphoJNVTn4msbe2wwg","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmVdf6P2dnt8Sa7hswoG9AvVSXDZjAN7QGv7dZgGi7XKGY","mimeType":"audio/x-wav","name":"Ahmed Sirour - Funky Introduction","project":{"artwork":{"uri":"ipfs://QmYKbgrHDWLfERMoiUfzpmTjigpLHphoJNVTn4msbe2wwg","mimeType":"image/jpeg"},"title":"Different Rooms, One House","description":"House music has taken on numerous forms since it's inception in the early 80s, coming right when Disco music was already on its decline at that period. The name was either connected to producers at the time (from Chicago to NYC) creating it in their houses or to the famous club in NYC called the Warehouse, where this type of music was played to cult audiences that were typically of the Black LGBTQ+ community of that era, and dropping of the \"ware\" part of the word, the music took on the moniker that it's had till present-day.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the particular album title I chose, as well as the cover art I created for it, is a double-sided meaning.

This song brings a bit more maturity to my songwriting, and I feel like this song represents a lot of emotions I had in lockdown.\r\n\r\nFeeling isolated for a year, and a lot of personal drama during that period made me long for an escape, and I've represented it with the waves on the track, as well as on the art.\r\n\r\nIn the original demo, the solo section was just an open section with an ambient lead guitar in the middle. But during writing, I felt that the ending deserves an amazing solo. That's where Mark came in, I just took a chance to ask him if he wants to write a solo, and waking up at 3 AM I found his reply. Wasn't expecting one of the greatest guitar players in the progressive metal scene to shred one for a track that's made in a random bedroom in Manila.\r\n\r\nI hope to whoever gets this 1-of-1, bottled and preserved piece of my emotions resonates and truly enjoys the song.\r\n\r\nThis song was released on October 14, 2021.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nWritten & Produced by: Mico Rigunay\r\nGuitar Solo by: Mark Holcomb (Periphery)\r\nProduced & Mixed by: Adam Bentley (Arch Echo)\r\nMastered by: Ermin Hamidovic (Systematic Productions)\r\nArt by: Sushant Vohra\r\nDedicated to: Faith Sabigan","duration":251.69,"external_url":"https://catalog.works/0xfef1cefb55a0D4D2D7754AD06603FD7349Bf0C35/aiur-feat-mark-holcomb--1675862040","image":"ipfs://QmfUvSsJNqYCpcAVacgoSkx8oeZ6VKYPAMwWeXtyKbNJ2S","losslessAudio":"ipfs://QmViUpBJARzCvhKdSLEAyZsY2et4PyDotwDtY7ZVmZPbkZ","mimeType":"audio/wav","name":"Mickosis - Aiur (feat.
